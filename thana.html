<b>IMPORTANT:</b><br><br>
If you are unable to load the site it means that your network cannot access IPv6 addresses. That's normal. Around 50% of the world still can't, so it's like a coin toss.
<br>
<a href="https://test-ipv6.com/">Test your IPv6 connectivity here</a>.
<br><br>
If you haven't got IPv6 connectivity, you can access the site by using the <a href="https://www.opera.com">Opera browser</a> and enable its built-in VPN. (a home/local VPN won't be enough)
<br><br>
Or you could try playing on your smartphone's browser when connected to a wi-fi network that supports IPv6. But be aware that this is a rare kind of game where you do the same amout of writing as reading.
