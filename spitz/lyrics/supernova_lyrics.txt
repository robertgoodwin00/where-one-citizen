  yaburisuteta inori nuiawasete yabutte
  hajiketobu hikari wa namida no sei janakatta
  inazuma no baiku de tokyo kara jigoku made
  fukurami mo kubomi mo mayowazu kakenuketa

Stitch together a broken prayer and break it.
The light that springs up was not the fault of your tears.
On a motorcycle of lightning from Tokyo to Hell
without losing one's way outrun the bulging and hollowing.

The thing you should love is that supernova.
Even a steel heart seems about to melt.

  ORENJI iro no e no gu de yogoshiau asa made
  nitenai you de niteru futari wa kizuiteta

Staining eachother until morning with the tools of an orange painting
The two of us resembling it in a way that we don't resemble were getting hurt.

  ai subekimono wa ano SUUPAA NOUA hitotsu nokorazu moyasou yo

It seems about to burn away without anything left.

  dou demo ii kisetsu ni kakumei wo yume miteta
  koushuu toire no kabe ni furui kotoba narabeta

On a season that I don't care for a saw a dream of a revolution.
I lined up old words on the wall of a public toilet stall.
