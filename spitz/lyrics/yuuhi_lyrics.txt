   Yuuhi ga Warau, Kimi mo Warau
   ("The setting sun laughs, you also laugh")  by Spitz

   words by Kusano Masamune


  koko ni iru dakiaitai koko ni iru
  yatara mujaki na engi de nakechau kurai
  motomeru mune ga itai motomeru
  kimi wa itsumo tsukarete fukigen na noni

You are here -- I want to hold you -- you are here
in a reckless, innocent (acting) performance that makes me cry.
I seek you -- my breast hurts within -- I seek you.
You are always tired even though you are sullen.    

--

  yuuhi ga warau kimi mo warau kara asu wo miru
  amai shizuku shita de uketomete tsunaideikou

The setting sun laughs.  Since you also laugh I will see tomorrow.
Catching the sweet trickling on my tongue I will go on connecting it all.

  kowagaru aisaretai kowagaru
  HEAPINKAABU ja itsumo kizutsuite bakari
  samayou nanimonai samayou
  chuutohanpa na kako mo taisetsu dakedo

Frightened -- wanting to be loved -- frightened,
I always just barely get hurt by a "hairpin" (sharp) curve.  
I wander -- there is nothing -- I wander.
The past in which one only goes halfway is important, but...

--
  
  yuuhi ga warau kimi mo warau kara asu wo miru
  katte ni kimeta RIZUMU ni awasete aruiteikou

The setting sun laughs.  Since you also laugh I will see tomorrow.
Joining it to the rhythm decided as I please, I will go on walking.
