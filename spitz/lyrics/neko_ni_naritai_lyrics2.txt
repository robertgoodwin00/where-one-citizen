Neko ni Naritai ("I want to be that cat")
   by Spitz


  akari o keshita mama hanashi o tsuzuketara
  glass no mukougawa de hoshi ga hitotsu kieta
  karamawarishinagara toori o kakenukete
  kudakeru sono toki wa kimi no namae dake yobu yo

Thru the window one star disappeared and we kept talking in the dark.
I raced through the streets, everything was wrecked, but it was only you I was calling.

  hirosugiru reien no soba no kono appato wa usugumori
  atatakai maboroshi o miteta

Through the clouds in this apartment
next to the broad cemetery, I can see some kind of warm illusion.

  neko ni naritai kimi no ude no naka 
  sabishii yoru ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai 
  kienai you ni kizu tsuketeageru yo

I want to be that cat. The one you are holding in your arms.
I want to be here ‘till this melancholy night ends.
I want to be that cat, my words aren’t in vain.
I will hurt you so bad, it will never go away!


  me o tojite ukabeta hisoyaka na nigebasho wa
  Sicily no hamabe no e-hagaki to yoku niteta

Close your eyes and float off to that secret place,
that looks like that post card of a beach in Sicily.


  sunabokori ni mamirete aruku machi wa kisetsu o kiratteru
  tsukurareta yasuragi o sutete

I walk, covered in dust this town hates this season.
I’ll throw away the contentment that I made.


  neko ni naritai kimi no ude no naka
  sabishii yori ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai
  kienai you ni kizu tsuketeageru yo

I want to be that cat. The one you are holding in your arms.
I want to be here ‘till this melancholy night ends.
I want to be that cat, my words aren’t in vain.
I will hurt you so bad, it will never go away!

  neko ni naritai kimi no ude no naka
  sabishii yori ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai
  kienai you ni kizu tsuketeageru yo

I want to be that cat. The one you are holding in your arms.
I want to be here ‘till this melancholy night ends.
I want to be that cat, my words aren’t in vain.
I will hurt you so bad, it will never go away!
