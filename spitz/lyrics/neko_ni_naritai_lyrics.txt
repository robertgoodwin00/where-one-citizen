  Neko ni Naritai ("I want to become a cat")
   by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune


  akari wo keshita mama hanashi wo tsuzuketara
  GARASU no mukougawa de hoshi ga hitotsu kieta
  karamawarishinagara toori wo kakenukete
  kudakeru sono toki wa kimi no namae dake yobu yo

If we continue our talk with the lights still out,
on the other side of the glass one star has faded.
While running idle, I go past the road.
When I go to pieces, that's the time that I call just your name.

  hirosugiru reien no soba no kono APAATO wa usugumori
  atatakai maboroshi wo miteta

This apartment next to a cemetary that is too large is a bit cloudy.
I was seeing a warm illusion.

  neko ni naritai kimi no mune no naka 
  sabishii yoru ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai 
  kienai you ni KIZU tsuketeageru yo

I want to become a cat in the middle of your breast.
I want to stay here until the lonely night is over.
I want to become a cat.  I won't say anything.
I'll give you a wound like it won't go away.

--

  me wo tojite ukabeta hisoyakana nigebasho wa
  SHICHIRIA no hamabe no e-HAGAKI to yoku niteta

Closing my eyes, the secret hideaway place that comes to my head
resembles well a picture postcard of the beaches of Sicily.

--

  sunabokori ni mamiretearuku machi wa kisetsu wo kiratteru
  tsukurareta yasuragi wo sutete

The town I walk in getting smeared with sand hates the season.
Throw away the made-up peace.

--

  neko ni naritai kimi no mune no naka
  sabishii yori ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai
  kienai you ni KIZU tsuketeageru yo

I want to become a cat in the middle of your breast.
I want to stay here until the lonely night is over.
I want to become a cat.  I won't say anything.
I'll give you a wound like it won't go away.

--

  neko ni naritai kimi no mune no naka
  sabishii yori ga owaru made koko ni itai yo
  neko ni naritai kotoba wa hakanai
  kienai you ni KIZU tsuketeageru yo

I want to become a cat in the middle of your breast.
I want to stay here until the lonely night is over.
I want to become a cat.  I won't say anything.
I'll give you a wound like it won't go away.
