Spitz- "Y"

chiisai na koe de boku wo yobu yami he to
te wo nobasu shizuka de nagai yoru
narasereteita okizari no toki kara
haiagari mujaki ni hohoenda kimi ni au mou ichi do

I stretch out my hand to the darkness that calls my name
in a small voice, in the stillness of this long night
Leaving behind the times I'd grown accustomed to
Crawling up your innocent smile, I meet you once again

tsuyogaru po-zu ga yoku niteta futari ha
hajikiai sono ato hikiatta
umareta koro to kawaranai kokoro de
sawattara subete ga kiesouna
kimi wo mitsumeteita

In a pose showing their courage, two people look so alike
The snapped meeting after we pulled against each other
If you were to touch me with a a heart which hasn't changed since
the time of birth, everything would have disappeared while
I stared at you

yagate kimi ha tori ni naru boroboro no yakusoku
mune ni daite 
kanashii koto mo aru dakedo yume wo tsuzuku
me wo fusenaide
maioriru yoake made

Before long you'll turn into a bird
there are many crumbly secrets and sad things you hold in your heart, 
but continue dreaming
Don't turn down your eyes until you fly down at dawn

yagate kimi ha tori ni naru boroboro no yakusoku 
mune ni idaite
kaze ni yureru mugi yasashii hi no omoide kamishimenagara
tsugihagi no mira-ju taisetsu na yakusoku me wo fusenaide
maioriru yoake made

Before long you'll turn into a bird- the crumbly secrets you hold in your heart
while you think about the wheat shaking in the wind and memories of gentle days
patches of a mirage of important secrets
Don't turn down your eyes until you fly down at dawn
