  hampa na kotoba demo kurai manazashi demo nan datte ore ni kure!
  kanashimi o nuritsubusou kimi wa dou omotteru?

Give me an incomplete sentence, a dark look, or something!
You seem to crush and smear sadness.  What are you thinking?  

---

  aesou de aenakute naitari shita ato de koe ga todoichattari shite
  hikiatteru zettai sou kimi wa dou omotteru?

After not being able to see eachother when it seemed like we could 
and crying, your voice is reaching me.
We are connected, definitely.  What are you thinking?

  sore wa nazo no yubiwa 
  itsuka DORIIMI na hi ni wa
  kimi ga nozomu youna dekoboko no uchuu e tsunagu

That is the ring of mystery.
Sometime on a dreamy day 
it connects to the uneven universe like the one you desire.

  sore wa nazo no yubiwa 
  saraba shareta yunivaasu
  kimi ga nozomu youna dekoboko no uchuu e tsunagu

That is the ring of mystery.
So long, stylish universe.  
It connects to the uneven universe like the one you desire.
