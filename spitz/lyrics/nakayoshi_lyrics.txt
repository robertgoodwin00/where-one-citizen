  Itsumo nakayoshi de ii yo ne tte iwarete
  Demo dokoka buruu ni natteta are wa koi datta
  Nan do mo kuchi no naka tsubuyaite mita
  Kasukana imeeji dake wo oimotometeta

It was always said "How nice to be friends".
But somewhere I was becoming blue.  That was love.
Over and over I tried to mutter those words in my mouth.
I was chasing only a faint image.

  Toki wa koborete iku yo chachina yume no sekai mo
  Sugu ni hirogatte iku yo kimi wa iroasenu mama

Time spills on by.  The world of a cheap dream does so also.  
Right away it goes on expanding.  You remain colored as you are.

  Warufuzake de tobeta no sa ki no sei da to satorazu ni
  Irareta nara

I was able to fly on a practical joke.
If I could have not realized it was a mere fancy...

  Sandaru baki no ashiyubi ni mitoreta
  Chiisana hana sakaseta are wa koi datta

I was charmed by the toes on your sandal-ed feet.
A tiny flower was allowed to bloom.  That was love.

  Ame agari no kire ma kara sashikomu hi no hikaritachi
  Machi wo arau

From an interval in the falling rain the inserted 
lights of a fire wash the town.
