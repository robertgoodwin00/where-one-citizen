  kawaii kimi ga suki na mono chotto oiboreteru piano
  sabishii boku wa chikashitsu no sumikko de uzukumaru spaidaa
  araitate no burausu ga ima sujigakidoori ni yogosarete yuku
  
A thing that 'cute you' likes; a slightly decrepit piano.
'Sad I' am a spider that crouches in a corner of the basement.  
Your freshly washed blouse will now literally become soiled.

  dakara motto tooku made kimi o ubatte nigeru
  rarara sen no yo o tobikoete hashiritsuzukeru

So I will steal you away to a farther place.
Lalala flying past a thousand nights we will continue to run.

  kawaii kimi o tsukamaeta totteoki no uso furimaite
  sabishii boku ni hi o tsukete shiranpuri haato-gata no raitaa
  kogane-iro no sakamichi de kasoku shitara nido to modorenai kara

I capture 'cute you', sprinkling lies that were held in reserve.
Unknowingly, a heart-shaped lighter sets fire to 'sad me'.  
Because if we accelerate down a golden hill there is no turning back.

When your strength is exhausted, then at that time laugh away!
