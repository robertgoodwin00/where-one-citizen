      Ai No Shirushi (Sign of Love) 
      by Spitz 

Yawa na haato ga shibireru 
Kokochi yoi hari no shigeki 
Wake mo nai no ni kagayaku 
Sore dake ga ai no shirushi 
==
My soft heart is numb because of a constant feeling.
Also, my heart is shining without reason.
This is a love sign.


Itsuka anata ni wa 
Subete uchiakeyou 
Sukoshi tsuyoku naru tame ni 
Kowareta booto de hitori koide yuku 
==
Someday I will tell you everything.
In order to be strong just a little,
I rode a boat alone which is sinking.


Yume no naka de mo wakaru 
Mekurumeku yoru no fushigi 
==
Even if I have a dream that I'm sleeping.
I know this will continue to be a mystery of the night.


Tada no omoide to 
Kaze ga sasayaitemo 
Ureshinaki no takaramono 
Nan demo arisou na kuni de 
Tada hitotsu 
==
If the wind said this is just a memory,
The treasure which I really like is the only
one in this country that has everything.


Yawa na haato ga shibireru 
Kokochi yoi hari no shigeki 
Wake mo nai no ni kagayaku 
Sore dake ga ai no shirushi 
Sore dake de ai no shirushi 
==
My soft heart is numb because of a constant feeling.
Also, my heart is shining without reason.
This is a love sign.
Because this is a love sign.
