      words by Kusano Masamune



  ame furitsuzuku yo ajisai doori o
  kasa sasazu ni ue muite hashitteku
  zenbu gochamaze ni suru mizushibuki

Rain keeps falling.  Without opening my umbrella
I look up and run down a hydrangea road.
The splashing water puts everything in disarray.

  itsumo warawarete saenai mainichi
  demo ano ko dake wa hikari no tsubu o
  chotto wakete kureta ashita no mado de

Every day is depressing and laughs at me
but, through the window of tomorrow,
it is only that girl who shares a few drops of light with me.

  dakara kono ame agare ano ko no hoho o terase hora
  namida no kazu nado wasurete
  kawaranu toki no nagare hamidasu tame ni kirisaite
  ima o te ni ireru

So rain stop falling and shine on the cheek of that girl.
Look, forget the number of tears shed.
Slicing a moment out of the unchanging flow of time
I obtain the 'now'.

  ai to iu yori zutto majime na jooku de
  motto karugaru watatte iketa nara
  uso kasuneta kioku o makimodosu

If you are able to cross more carelessly
with a serious joke rather than what you would call love,
a memory of accumulated lies will rewind.

  datte shinjiru koto wa manuke na geemu to
  nando iikikaseta ka mayoi no naka de
  tada omoi tobira oshitsuzuketeta

Because in the confusion of telling myself over and over
that to believe is a foolish game,
I was just pushing a heavy door that wouldn't open.

  dakara kono ame agare ano ko no hoho o terase hora
  yoseatsumeta hana kakaete
  na mo nai machi de hitori hajimete yume o sagasu no sa
  ima o te ni ireru

So rain stop falling and shine on the cheek of that girl.
Look, carry in your arms the gathered flowers.
In a town with no name I search for my dream for the first time.  
I obtain the 'now'.
