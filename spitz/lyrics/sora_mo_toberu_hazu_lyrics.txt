  Osanai binetsu o sagerarenai mama kamisama no kage o osorete
  Kakushita naifu ga niawanai boku o odoketa uta de nagusameta

Not being able to have a childish fever lowered, fearing the shadow of God
A hidden knife that didn't suit me comforted me with a funny song.

---

  Iroasenagara hibiwarenagara kagayaku sube o motomete

While the color fades and a cracks open up, seek a shining means.

  Kimi to deatta kiseki ga kono mune ni afureteru
  Kitto ima wa jiyuu ni sora mo toberu hazu
  Yume o nurashita namida ga umibara e nagaretara
  zutto soba de waratteite hoshii

The miracle that I met you is overflowing in my heart.
Certainly now I can fly even into the sky.
After the tears that washed by dreams flow to the sea
I want you laughing by my side continually.

  Kirifuda ni shiteta miesuita uso wa mangetsu no yoru ni yabuita

The flimsy lie I told as a last resort was broken with the full moon.

---

  Hakanaku yureru kami no nioi de fukai nemuri kara samete

With the smell of your wispy flowing hair I awaken from a deep sleep.

  Kimi to deatta kiseki ga kono mune ni afureteru
  Kitto ima wa jiyuu ni sora mo toberu hazu
  Gomi de kirameku sekai ga bokutachi o kobande mo
  zutto soba de waratteite hoshii

The miracle that I met you is overflowing in my heart.
Certainly now I can fly even into the sky.
Even if this world glittering with garbage rejects us,
I want you laughing by my side continually.
