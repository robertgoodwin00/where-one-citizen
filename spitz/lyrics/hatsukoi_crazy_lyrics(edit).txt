Hatsukoi Crazy 
(Hatsukoi is the first person you ever fell in love with)
by Spitz
Words by Kusano Masamune

Minareta hazu no machi nami mo
Do hade ni utsusu orokamono
Kimi no sei de okikunatta mirai

I ought to have been used to the look and feel of the city,
And the fools who project their gaudy reflection.
Thanks to you the future has become so big.

Yume no sekai to urahara no
Kurushi magire hitori goto mo
Wasurerareta aisu no youni toketa

A world of dreams and contradictory words spoken to myself in desperation is forgotten,
Like melted ice.

Darekare sukima o nukete
Okashina himitsu no basho e
Kimi to iku no sa mayowazu ni
Kotoba ni dekinai kimochi hitasura tsutaeru chikara
Omote no imi o koete yaru sore dake de

Somebody slips through the cracks
To that strange secret place.
I go with you.  Without wavering.
Feelings I can't put into words.
Earnestly seeking the ability to convey them
To cross over the surface meaning, just that will do.

Karui beze de mitasarete
Tooboeshiteta tsunehigoro
Chigau shiki wa atto iu mani sugite

I am filled to satisfaction with your light kiss.
Regular days were howling.
A different season passes by just like that.

Kokoro no puropera mawasu
Bakageta himitsu no basho e
Yakusoku dayo ne
Futari kiri

The propellers in my heart are turning.
Just the two of us to that ridiculously secret place.
It's a promise.
The two of us alone.

Yasashiku narenai tokimo
Yasashiku sarenai tokimo
Kakureta sora wa aoi daro
Ima no mama

There are times when you can't be kind to me.
There are times when I can't be kind to you.
The hidden sky is still blue
Just like it is now.

Naki mushi ni naru
Usotsuki ni naru
Hoshi ni negatte mo
Tatoeba boku ga
Modorenai hodo ni kowarete ite mo

I become a crybaby
I become a liar
Even if I wish on a star.
Even if I am so broken that I can't go back...

Darekare sukima o nukete
Okashina himitsu no basho e
Kimi to iku no sa mayowazu ni
Kotoba ni dekinai kimochi hitasura tsutaeru chikara
Omote no imi o koete yaru sore dake de
Koete yaru sore dake de

Somebody slips through the cracks
To that strange secret place.
I go with you.  Without wavering.
Feelings I can't put into words.
Earnestly seeking the ability to convey them
To cross over the surface meaning, just that will do.
