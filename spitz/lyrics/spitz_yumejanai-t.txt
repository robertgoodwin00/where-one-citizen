            by SPITZ 

 Atatakai basho wo sagashi oyoideta 
 Saigo no ritou de kimi wo mitsumete ita 
 Kimi wo mitsumete ita 
==
I've swum seeking for a warm place 
In the last detached island 
Staring at you, staring at you 


 Onaji rizumu de yureteru buranko de 
 Akubishisou na kimi wo mitsumete ita 
 Kimi wo mitsumete ita 
==
Sitting on the swing, swinging same rhythm with mine 
You seemed like you wanna yawn 
Staring at you, staring at you... 



 Yume ja nai hitori ja nai 
 Kimi ga soba ni iru kagiri 
 Ibitsu na chikara de mamoritai 
 Doko made mo 
==
Not a dream. I'm not alone as long as you stay by my side 
I wanna cover you with my distorted power, forever 


 Oka ni nobottara ituka mita keshiki 
 Kisetsu no mahou de kimi ni umorete ita 
 Kimi ni umorete ita 
==
Climbing the hill and I could see a scene I've ever seen 
With the spell of the season, I was 
Buried in you, buried in you... 


 Yume ja nai hitori ja nai 
 Kimi ga soba ni iru kagiri 
 Ibitsu na chikara de mamoritai 
 Doko made mo 
==
Not a dream. I'm not alone as long as you stay by my side 
I wanna cover you with my distorted power, forever

 Kegarenai kemono ni wa modorenai sekai de mo

Not a dream. I'm not alone as long as you stay by my side 
Even if we can't go back to be pure animals, 


 Yume ja nai hitori ja nai 
 Kimi ga soba ni iru kagiri 
 Ibitsu na chikara de mamoritai 
 Dokomade mo
