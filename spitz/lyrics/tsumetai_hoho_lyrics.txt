  anata no koto o fukaku aiseru kashira
  kodomo mitai na hikari de boku o someru
  kaze ni fukareta kimi no tsumetai hoho ni
  furetemita chiisana gogo

I wonder if I could love you deeply.
You bathe me in childlike light.
It was on a little evening that I tried touching
your cold cheek blown by the wind.

  akiramekaketa tanoshii kakuu no hibi ni
  ichido-kiri nara todokisou na ki ga shiteta
  daremo shiranai toko e nagareru mama ni
  jareteita neko no you ni

On fun imaginary days that I had begun to tire of
I was getting the feeling that if it had been only once,
things would be fulfilled,
flowing on to a place that nobody knows,
like a playful cat.

  fuzakesugite koi ga maboroshi demo
  kamawanai to itsushika omotteita
  kowarenagara kimi o oikaketeku
  chikazuite mo tookute mo shitteita

I had thought then that if I joked around too much
love, being unreal, wouldn't mind.  
I knew that while destroying it I would go on
chasing you near or far.

  sore wa subete de
  nani mo nai koto
  toki no shawaa no naka de

That is everything, there is nothing,
in the shower of time.

  yume no tsubu mo sugu ni hajiku you na
  sakaagari no sekai o miteita
  kowarenagara kimi o oikaketeku
  chikazuite mo tookute mo shitteita

I was looking at the world of the past,
like drops of dreams that quickly rebound up.
I knew that while destroying it I would go on
chasing you near or far.

  sore wa subete de
  nani mo nai koto
  toki no shawaa no naka de

That is everything, there is nothing,
in the shower of time.

  sayonara boku no kawaii shirotsumekusa to
  techou na sumi de nemuritsuzukeru sutoorii
  kaze ni fukareta kimi no tsumetai hoho ni
  furetemita chiisana gogo

Saying "Goodbye, my cute wildflower" in a nook of 
my notebook is the story that continues to sleep. 
It was on a little evening that I tried touching
your cold cheek blown by the wind.
