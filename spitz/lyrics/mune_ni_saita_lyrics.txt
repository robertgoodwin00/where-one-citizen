Mune ni Saita Kiiroi Hana - Spitz



Tsuki no hikari sashikomu heya
Kinou made no sabaku no hitori asobi
Mune ni saita kiiroi hana
Kimi no kokoro yadoshita hana

Kono mama boku no soba ni ite zutto
Mou kienaide ne
Kawaite karekakatta boku no mune ni

Tetsu no tobira kojiaketara
Boku wo kaeru nanika ga aru to kiita
Kimi to warau  minna sutete
Machi no oto ni momarenagara

Kono mama boku no soba ni ite zutto
Mou kienaide ne
Kawaite karekakatta boku no mune ni

Yowaki kagayaiteru
Yoi no hotaru no you ni
Doko e nagasareteku
Kiroi hana

Toki no yodomi yukute wo shiri
Asu ni nareba kono maboroshi mo owaru
Mune ni saita kiiroi hana
Kimi no kokoro yadoshita hana

Kono mama boku soba ni ite zutto
Mou kienaide ne
Kawaite karekakatta boku no mune ni

Kono mama boku soba ni ite zutto
Mou kienaide ne
Kawaite karekakatta boku no mune ni

The Yellow Flower Blooming in my Heart

Moonlight fills the room
Until yesterday I was just playing alone in the desert
A yellow flower blooms in my heart, a flower your heart seeded

Stay with me like this forever
Don't ever disappear
From my heart so dry it had nearly withered

You pried open the iron door
And asked if there was anything that could change me
Laughing with you, casting everyone else aside,
Buffeted by the noises of the city

Stay with me like this forever
Don't ever disappear
From my heart so dry it had nearly withered

Sparkling faintly
Like a firefly at dusk
Being carried away somewhere
This yellow flower

I know that time has a way of going nowhere
And when morning comes even this illusion will end
A yellow flower blooms in my heart, a flower your heart seeded

Stay with me like this forever
Don't ever disappear
From my heart so dry it had nearly withered

Stay with me like this forever
Don't ever disappear
From my heart so dry it had nearly withered
