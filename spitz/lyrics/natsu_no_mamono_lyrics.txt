    Natsu no Mamono 
    ("Natsu no Mamono") by Spitz 

     words by Kusano Masamune


  furui apaato no beranda ni tachi
  boku o mioroshite sukoshi waratta      
  namanurui kaze ni tanabiku shiroi shittsu

Standing on the veranda of the old apartment,
white sheets hang upon the lukewarm wind that
overlooks me and laughs a little.

  sakana mo inai dobugawa koete
  ikutsu mo koeteyuku futari-nori de
  oresou na te de yoroyoro shite sa owareru you ni


Crossing the muddy stream,
the two of us crossing as many as there are,
I totter on a hand about to break, as if being chased.


  osanai dake no hisoka na okite no ue de kimi to mita
  natsu no mamono ni aitakatta aitakatta aitakatta

Following the secret rule of childhood only,
I wanted to meet the summer devil that you and I saw.
..wanted to meet..wanted to meet


  ootsubu no ame sugu ni agaru sa
  nagaku nobita kage ga oboreta koro 
  nureta kumo no su ga hikatteita naiteru mitai ni

Heavy drops of rain stop falling soon.
Back when the long shadow drowned,
the wet spider's nest was glimmering as if it was crying.  


  koroshite shimaeba ii to omotta keredo kimi ni nita
  natsu no mamono ni aitakatta aitakatta aitakatta

I thought it would be good to kill it, but
I wanted to meet the summer devil that looked like you.  
..wanted to meet..wanted to meet 


  osanai dake no hisoka na okite no ue de kimi to mita
  natsu no mamono ni aitakatta
  boku no jumon mo kikanakatta
  natsu no mamono ni aitakatta aitakatta aitakatta
  aitakatta

Following the secret rule of childhood only,
I wanted to meet the summer devil that you and I saw.
My spell didn't work.
I wanted to meet the summer devil.
..wanted to meet..wanted to meet
..wanted to meet.
