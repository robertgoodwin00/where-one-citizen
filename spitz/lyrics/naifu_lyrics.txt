    Naifu
    ("Knife") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  kimi wa chiisakute kanashii hodo muboubi de
  muchi de nonki de yasashii kedo usotsuki de
  mou sugu da ne sangatsu no kimi no BAASUDEI niwa
  HANTENGUNAIFU no gotsui yatsu wo ageru mottete

You are small and defenseless to the point of pity,
ignorant, carefree, and gentle, but a liar.
It's coming soon, isn't it.  For your March birthday
I will give you a tough hunting knife.  Take it.

  kimi ga kono NAIFU wo horishimeru IMEEJI wo
  mainichi mainichi ukabenagara sugoshiteru yo
  me wo tojite fukanzen na heya ni kaeru yo
  itsu ni nattemo haresou ni nai kiri no naka de

Everyday while thinking of the image you engrave 
with this knife I'll live on.
Closing my eyes I return to an imperfect room
in the midst of fog that never clears.

  hateshinai SABANNA wo iku   shinayaka de tsuyoi ashi de
  yuugure no sABANNA wo iku  furimukazu me wo hikarasete
  chimamire no yume yurusarete  kokoro ge kawakanai uchi ni
  SARU kara HITO e edawakareshite  koko ni iru bokura wa

I travel through an endless savannah, with supple strong feet.
I travel through a savannah at dusk, without turning around I let my eye twinkle.
A blood-smeared dream is permitted, before my heart dries up.
Our family tree goes from monkey to man, for the the two of us here.

  mikan-iro no mangatsu ga fukuramu gogo rokuji ni
  SHIRUBAA no BIITORU wo mikaketa nda 20-gou de
  kondo koso nanika ii koto kitto aru darou
  itsu ni nattemo hareseou ni nai kiri no naka de

At 6:00 PM when a full moon the color of a mikan swelled
I spotted a silver beetle; #20.
This time for sure there will be something good,
in the midst of a fog that never clears.

  muchi de nonki de yasashii kedo usotsuki de
  mou sugu da ne sangatsu no kimi no BAASUDEI niwa

You are small and defenseless to the point of pity,
ignorant, carefree, and gentle, but a liar.
It's coming soon, isn't it.  For your March birthday
I will give you a tough hunting knife.  Take it.
