   ROURANDAA, Sora e
   ("To the lowlands of the sky") by Spitz

   words by Kusano Masamune


  hateshinaku dokomademo tsuzuku
  kunekune to tsuzuku hosoi michi no
  tochuu de tachitomari kimi wa 
  ikudomo unazuki sora wo mita

Stopping midway on a meandering road that continues
on with no end, that continues to wherever,
you nodded several times and watched the sky.

  tobe ROURANDAA
  shuro no hoshi e 
  shuro no hoshi e
  tadoritsuku made

Fly to the lowlands
Fly to the lowlands
to the star of the hemp plam
to the star of the hemp palm
until you reach it

  kono mama shizuka ni hitsuji no 
  me wo shite owari wo matsu KOMEDEI
  utagau koto nado shirazu ni
  nanika ni owarete toki wo yuku

It is a comedy in which one waits silently like this
with sheep eyes, waiting for the end.
Without knowing doubt or anything,
one passes the time, being chased by something.

  "shiroi tsubasa to shiroi panama-bou
  nagisa no kaze wo karada ni matou
  yume wo mita no sa"

"I don white wings, a white panama (hat), and
the wind of the beach.  I saw a dream."
