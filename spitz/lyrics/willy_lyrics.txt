    UIRII 
    ("Willy") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune



  saru ga yuku saru no naka wo
  mucha shitemo TAFU na MOOTAA de
  dandan yametai kimochi wakiagatte mo te ni ireru made
  mou nido to koko niha modoranai

Monkey goes among monkeys.
Even being reckless, with a tough motor.
Though you gradually feel that you want to quit, until you obtain it
you won't return here again.

  UIRII kodoku na hourousha itsuka ha
  UIRII todoku hazu sa

Willy, a lonely wanderer, some day
Willy, you will get where you are going

--

  ame no hi mo onaji SUTAIRU de
  kasa mo naku iki ha shiroi noni
  denwa mo KURUMA mo shiranai nemurenai nara isso asa made
  ookina yoru to odoriakasou

Even on rainy days, in the same style,
without an umbrella, though your breath is white,
you know not phone nor car.  If you can't sleep then you better
dance with the big night until morning when it gets bright.

--

  UIRII kodoku na hourousha itsuka ha
  UIRII todoku hazu sa

Willy, a lonely wanderer, some day
Willy, you will get where you are going

--

  amaku nigaku 
  sore ha daraku janaku

Sweetly, bitterly.
That isn't decadence.
