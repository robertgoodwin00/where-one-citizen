Wasure wa shinai yo, toki ga nagaretemo
Itazua na yaritori ya
Kokoro no toge sae mo kimi ga waraeba mou
Chiisaku maruku natte ita koto
--
I won't forget, even as time flows by
How our mischievous exchanges of words
And even the thorns in my heart, when you smiled
Would become small and soft


Kawaru gawaru nozoita ana kara
Nani wo miteta ka naa?
Hitorikiri ja kanaerarenai
Yume mo atta keredo
--
I wonder what you could see?
From the hole we took turns peeking through
Though we had dreams
That we couldn't fulfill alone


Sayonara, kimi no koe wo daite aruite iku
Aa, boku no mama de dokomade todoku darou
--
Farewell, embracing your voice I'll keep walking
Ah, I wonder how far I'll get as I am


Sagashite ita no sa, kimi to au hi made
Ima ja natsukashii kotoba
GARASU no mukou niwa mizutama no kumo ga
Chirakatte ita ano hi made
--
I'd searched for it, until I met you
Those words that would even now bring back memories
Beyond the glass, the water droplet clouds
Had scattered, until that day


Kaze ga fuite tobasaresou na
Karui tamashii de
Tanin to onaji you na shiawase wo
Shinjite ita noni
--
With spirits so light
That they seem ready to be blown away by the wind
I had believed in
Happiness like other people had


Korekara kizutsuitari dareka kizutsuketemo
Aa, boku no mama de dokomade todoku darou
--
From now on, even if I'm hurt or hurt someone else
Ah, I wonder how far I'll get as I am


Mabataki suru hodo nagai kisetsu ga kite
Yobiau namae ga kodamashi hajimeru
Kikoeru?
--
A season so long it makes me blink has arrived
The names we called each other start to play pranks on us
Can you hear me?


Sayonara, kimi no koe wo daite aruite iku
Aa, boku no mama de dokomade todoku darou
--
Farewell, embracing your voice I'll keep walking
Ah, I wonder how far I'll get as I am


Aa, kimi no koe wo daite aruite iku
Aa, boku no mama de dokomade todoku darou
Aa, kimi no koe wo...
--
Ah, embracing your voice I'll keep walking
Ah, I wonder how far I'll get as I am
Ah, your voice...
