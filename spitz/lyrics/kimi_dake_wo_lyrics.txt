Kimi dake wo
by Spitz

words by Kusano Masamune

Machi wa yoru ni tsutsumare
Yukikau hitodama no naka 
Otona ni natta kanoshimi o
Miushinaiso de kowaii
Kudakarete iku bokura wa

The town is wrapped up in the night
as a disembodied soul comes back to life
I'm scared to think that I might lose the sadness
of becoming an adult
We are being crushed

Hoshi no namae mo shirazu
Akari tomosu koto mo naku
Shiroi oto ni uzumore
Kabi kusai mofu o daki
Omoi o haseru
Yozora ni

Without knowing the name of the stars
or how to turn on the lights
I am burried in the white sound
Holding on to a moldy muffler
My thoughts turn to the night sky

Kimi dake o kanarazu
Kimi dake o
Egaiteru
Zutto

Only you Always
Only you
I smile
Forever

Hitori itsumo no michi o
Aruku me o tojite hitori 
Bukiyo na te de kumitateru
Yogoretta mama no kakera de
Itsuka de aeru toki made

Alone I close my eyes and walk along
the same old street alone
With my awkward hands
I try to put the dirty fragments back together
Until we meet again

Kimi dake o kanarazu
Kimi dake o
Egaiteru
Zutto

Only you Always
Only you
I smile
Forever

Kimi dake o kanarazu
Kimi dake o
Egaiteru
Zutto

Only you Always
Only you
I smile
Forever
