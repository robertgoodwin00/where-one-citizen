    Ai no Kotoba

    words by Kusano Masamune



  kagiri aru mirai o shiboritoru hibi kara
  nukedasou to sasotta kimi no me ni utsuru umi

From the days that wring out a limited future,
the ocean is reflected in your eyes
as you invite me to sneak out.

  kudaranai hanashi de yasurageru bokura wa
  sono orokasa koso ga nani yori mo takaramono

We are soothed by trivial talk, the very silliness
of which is, more than anything, a treasure.

---

  mukashi atta kuni no eiga de 
  ichido mita you na michi o yuku
  namanurui kaze ni fukarete

We walk down a road like one once seen in a movie
of a country from long ago,
being blown by the warm wind.

  ima kemuri no naka de tokeainagara sagashitsuzukeru ai no kotoba
  kizutsuku koto mo nameau koto mo tsutsumikomareru ai no kotoba

Melting together in the midst of smoke now are the words 
of love that we continue to search for.
Though we hurt eachother and heal eachother, words of love
surround and envelop us.

  yasashii sora no iro itsumo-toori karera no
  aoi chi ni somatta nantonaku usui sora

The color of the gentle sky; a somewhat thin sky 
that is dyed in their blue blood as always.

  kogekusai machi no hikari ga 
  pettobotoru de kudakechiru
  chigau inochi ga yureteiru

The light of the town reeking with smoke
scatters and is dispersed through a plastic bottle.
Different lives are flickering.

---

  ima kemuri no naka de tokeainagara sagashitsuzukeru ai no kotoba
  mou kore ijou susumenakute mo sagashitsuzukeru ai no kotoba


Melting together in the midst of smoke now are the words 
of love that we continue to search for.
The words we continue to search for; 
even if we proceed no further than this.

---

  kumoma kara koboreochiteku kamisama-tachi ga mieru
  kokoro no ito ga kireru hodo tsuyoku dakishimeta nara

Spilling down from the clouds, the Gods can be seen
if we hold eachother so strongly that the threads of our hearts snap.

  ima kemuri no naka de tokeainagara sagashitsuzukeru ai no kotoba
  kizutsuku koto mo nameau koto mo tsutsumikomareru ai no kotoba

Melting together in the midst of smoke now are the words 
of love that we continue to search for.
Even though we hurt eachother and heal eachother, words of love
surround and envelop us.
