  boku ni shika mienai chizu wo hirogete hitori de miteta
  me o ageta toki ni wa mou taiyou wa shizundeita
  tsukuri kake no ooki na machi wa nana iro no kemuri no naka
  wakaranai kimi no kotoba tsutsumi kami kara toridashite iru

I was unfolding and looking at the map that nobody but myself can see.
When I looked up, the sun was already setting.
In the midst of seven colors of smoke in a large newly-built town
I have taken out the folded piece of paper that has your words 
that I couldn't understand.

  nagareboshi nagareboshi sugu ni kiechau kimi ga suki de
  nagareboshi nagareboshi hontou no kamisama ga
  onaji kao de boku no madobe ni arawaretemo

Shooting star, shooting star.  Loving you who is gone suddenly...
Shooting star, shooting.  Even if the real God
appeared at my windowside with the same face...

  kimi no kokoro no naka ni sumu mukade ni kami tsukareta hi
  hikarabikaketeita boku no ashita ga mieta ki ga shita
  dareka wo nikundeta koto mo nanika ni obieta koto mo
  zenbu kasunjau kurai no shizuka na yoru ni ukande itai

On the day that it is bitten by the centipede that dwells in your heart
I feel as if I have seen my withered future.
I want to float into a silent night in which all of my hatreds towards
other people and fears towards something have become hazy.

  nagareboshi nagareboshi sugu ni kiechau kimi ga suki de
  nagareboshi nagareboshi hontou no kamisama ga
  onaji kao de boku no madobe ni arawaretemo

Shooting star, shooting star.  Loving you who is gone suddenly...
Shooting star, shooting.  Even if the real God
appeared at my windowside with the same face...
