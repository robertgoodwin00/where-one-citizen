     words by Kusano Masamune


  komaraseta nowa kimi no koto
  nazeka mabushiku omoete sa
  surigarasu no mado o aketa toki ni
  yomigaeru hokori no tsubu-tachi o ugokazu ni miteitai

What confused me is you.
For some reason I am able to glaringly think that.
When I open the frosted glass window
I want to watch unmovingly the dust particles that come alive.

  sanshain shiroi michi wa doko made mo tsuzuku yo
  sanshain samui tokai ni orite mo
  kawarazu natsu no hana no mama de ite

Sunshine; a white road continues on endlessly
Sunshine; even if it falls on this cold city
summer flowers stay as they are.

  kogeta nioi ni tsutsumareta
  ookina basu de kimi wa yuku
  yurusareta kisetsu ga owaru mae ni
  chirabaru omoide o hajime kara nokorazu kumitatetai
  
You depart on a large bus
that is enveloped in a burning smell.  
Before this season that has been allowed me ends
I want to assemble all the scattering memories from the beginning.

  sanshain meguru kaze ni yorokete mo
  kawarazu natsu no hana no mama de ite

Sunshine; a white road continues on endlessly
Sunshine; even if it staggers in the circulating wind
summer flowers stay as they are.
