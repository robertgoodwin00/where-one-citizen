  Yume Oi Mushi ("The bug that chases dreams") 
   by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune
  

  warattari naitari atarimae no seikatsu wo
  futari de sugoseba hane mo haeru saikou dane!

If the two of us lead a ordinary life of laughing and crying
our feathers will grow.  That is the best, isn't it!

  bijin janai mahou mo nai baka na kimi ga sukisa
  tochuu kara kawattemo subete yurushite yarou

You are neither a great beauty nor is there any magic;
I love the silly you all the same.  
Even if you changed midway (through our relationship)
I would forgive you everything.   

--

  yume de mita ano bashou ni tatsu hi made
  bokura wa sukoshi zutsu susumu  akumademo

Until the day that we reach that place seen in a dream
we will continue on little by little to the very end.

--

  hakisou na kurai ochisou na kurai ero ni mayoikonde yuku
  okashina yume desuga real nanoda honki deshou?

We continue on lost in eroticism to the point of feeling sick
and collapsing.
It's a strange dream, but it is in fact real.  
We are serious about it, aren't we?

--

  yume de mita ano bashou ni tatsu hi made
  bokura wa sukoshizutsu susumu akumademo

Until the day that we reach that place seen in a dream
we will continue on little by little to the very end.

--

  inochi mijikaki  chippoke na mushi desu
  ureshikute kanashikute kimi to odoru

I am a tiny bug with a short life.
Happy and sad, I dance with you. 

--

  ue miruna shita miruna daremo ga sou iu keredo
  akogare uragirare kizutsukanai houhou mo
  mi ni tsuke norikoe doko he ikou ka?

"Don't look up and don't look down."  Anyone would say that but,
fasten on to yourself a method of not getting hurt yearning for and 
being betrayed (by the one you love), and overcome.  
To where shall we go?
 
--

  yume de mita ano bashou ni tatsu hi made
  bokura wa sukoshizutsu susumu  akumademo
  yume de mita ano bashou ni tatsu hi made
  kezurete herinagara susumu akumademo
  akumademo

Until the day that we reach that place seen in a dream
we will continue on little by little to the very end.
Until the day that we reach that place seen in a dream
while it fades away and becomes diminished we will 
continue on to the very end.
...to the very end.
