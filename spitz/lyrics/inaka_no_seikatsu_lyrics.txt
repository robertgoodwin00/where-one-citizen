    Inaka no Seikatsu 
    ("Country life") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  nameraka ni sunda sawa no mizu wo
  tamerau koto mo naku nagashikomi
  natsukashiku kaoru gogo no kaze wo
  nureta kubisuji ni ukete warau

Without hesitation I drink the
smooth, clear stream water.
I receive the familiar smelling evening wind
on the scruff of my neck and laugh.

  nousagi no hashirinukeru sama mo
  sasa yuri hikaru hana no sugata mo
  yozora ni matataku hoshi no gure mo
  atarimae ni boku no me no naka ni

The manner of the hare running away,
the shape of the bright lilies and bamboo grass,
the constellation blinking in the night sky,
all reflect naturally in my eyes.

  kanarazu todoku to shinjiteita maboroshi
  kotoba ni mamireta NEGA no machi ha tsuzuku
  sayonara sayonara mado no soto no kimi ni
  sayonara iwanakkya

The illusion I believed would surely arrive.
Smeared with words, a negative image of the town persists.
Goodbye, goodbye to you outside the window.
I must say goodbye.

--

  ichibandori no uta de mezamete
  kanata no yama wo mite akubi shite
  itadaki no shiro ni omoihaseru
  suberiochiteiku kokoro no shizuku
 
Waking up at the song of the first cock crow,
I see the far away mountain and yawn.
It makes me miss the snow-capped peaks;
a droplet of the heart goes sliding downwards.

--

  neyasai no doro wo arau kimi to
  engawa ni asobu bokura no ko to
  utsurautsura yawaraka na hizashi
  owaru koto no nai rinne no ue
 
You washing mud from the root vegetables,
our child playing on the porch,
and the soft lazy sunlight
are part of the cycle of the soul that never ends.

  ano hi no tawago to gin no hako ni tsumete
  sayonara sayonara NEGA no machi ha tsuzuku
  sayonara sayonara itsu no hi ni ka kimi to
  mata aetara ii na

Stuffing the nonsense from that day in a silver box,
I say goodbye, goodbye.  
The negative image of the town persists.
Goodbye, goodbye.
I hope I will meet you again someday.
