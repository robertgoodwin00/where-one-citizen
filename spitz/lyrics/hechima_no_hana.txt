  futari no yume hechima no hana mitsumeru dake de
  kanashiii koto nado wasuresou ni naru
  hajirau you ni tatazumu hana sakaseru hi made
  sayonara iwanai nani ga atte mo

Just looking at the dream of the two of us, the Loofah flower,
we become so that we seem to forget the sad things.
Until the day when the flower stands still as if ashamed
we will not say goodbye, no matter what.

  sabishiii namidame ni utsuru no wa yagate atatakana ai no hana
  fukaku miruku-iro ni kemuru machi o hadashi de aruiteiru
  itsu no toki mo futari de

What is reflected in your sad teary eyes is the warm flower of love.
We are walking with bare feet through a town thick with milk-colored smoke.
Always the two of us together...

  futari no yume hechima no hana kanaete hoshii
  tobenai tori da to kizukasarete mo

I want the dream of the two of us, the Loofah flower, to be granted,
even if it is realized to be a bird that cannot fly.

  yamashii tsubuyaki no saigo ni mo yagate atatakana ai no hana
  fukaku miruku-iro ni kemuru machi o hadashi de aruiteiru
  itsu no toki mo futari de

Even at the end of a guilty murmur, before long there is a warm flower of love.
We are walking with bare feet through a town thick with milk-colored smoke.
Always the two of us together...
