Toki wo tomete kimi no egao ga
Mune no sunaji ni shimikonde yuku yo
Yami no tochuu de yatto kizuita
Sugu ni kiesou de kanashii hodo sasayaka na hikari
--
Stopping time, your smile
Seeps into the desert of my heart
I finally noticed, in the middle of darkness
That light, about to disappear, depressingly faint


Namanurui yasashisa wo motome
Kawari tsuzukeru machi no naka de
Owaranai yokubou umeru yori
Natsukashii uta nimo nita
--
Wanting half-hearted kindness
In the middle of this changing town
It seemed more like a nostaligic song
Rather than burying endless desires


Amai kotoba mimi ni tokashite
Boku no subete wo yogoshite hoshii
Tadashii mono wa kore ja nakutemo
Wasuretakunai azayaka de mijikai maboroshi
--
Your sweet words melt in my ears
I want you to taint everything about me
Even if that's not right
I don't want to forget that vivid, short-lived illusion


Hitotsuzutsu baramaite katazuke
Umarete shinu made no NORUMA kara
Kami no you na tsubasa de habataki
Dokoka tooi tokoro made
--
Scatter and gather them one by one
Flapping with paper-like wings
Fly away from the work you must do until you die
To someplace far away


Toki wo tomete kimi no egao ga
Mune no sunaji ni shimikonde yuku yo
Amai kotoba mimi ni tokashite
Boku no subete wo yogoshite hoshii
Tadashii mono wa kore ja nakutemo
Wasuretakunai azayaka de mijikai maboroshi
Sore wa maboroshii
--
Stopping time, your smile
Seeps into the desert of my heart
Your sweet words melt in my ears
I want you to taint everything about me
Even if that's not right
I don't want to forget that vivid, short-lived illusion
It was an illusion
