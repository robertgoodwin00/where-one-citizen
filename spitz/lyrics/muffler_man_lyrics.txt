  Mafuraaman ("Mufflerman")

  words by Kusano Masamune


  akai MAFURAA ga kaze wo ukete
  moeru hodo ni SUPIIDO ageteku
  hada wo sasu you na hikari abite
  zutto boku wa hashiritsuzukeru
  
A red muffler catches the wind, 
accelerating on to the point of burning.
Being bathed in light that seems to pierce the flesh, 
I continue running without cease.

  MAFURAAMAN itsumo kimi wo sagasu
  HAIPAA na ai ni kakeru

Mufflerman, I always search for you.
I stake hyper love on it.

--

  nakitsukarete iya na omoide mo
  minna matomete suritsubushiteku
  karui handan de hanatsu BURASUTAA ga
  kenzen na aku wo fukitobashiteku

Tired of crying, I gather all the unpleasant memories
and grind them to nothing.
A blaster fired on a light judgement 
will blow away wholesome evil.

--

  MAFURAAMAN ESUPAA ga kimi wo osou
  SUPONSAA no koukai wo koete
  
Mufflerman, ESP will come upon you,
overcoming the regret of your sponsor.

--

  nagasareta doku sae mo amai aji ga suru
  yasuagari na sachi demo ima nara shineru
  
Even the flow of poison has a sweet taste.
With even an economical suffering I can die now.

--

  MAFURAAMAN taiyou mo itsuka kieru
  GURUUVII ni ENJIN wo fukasu
  MAFURAAMAN itsumo kimi wo sagasu
  HAIPAA na ai ni kakeru

Mufflerman, even the sun will someday fade.
The engine blows groovily.
Mufflerman, I always search for you.
I stake hyper love on it.
