   ("If I lived with you..") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  midori no tonneru nukete asa no hikari ni arawareru you na
  wazuka na hohoemi sae mo nokorazu minna wakeaeru you na
  kawaii toshitsuki o kimi to kurasetara

Like coming out of a green tunnel and being washed in the morning light;
Like a time when everybody shares even a few smiles with eachother;
If I could live with you through those kind of cute years...

  jiguzagu kodamashinagara koe ga tooku made todoite ikisou na
  miagereba kumo no nagare ni  ima iru basho o wasurechaisou na
  sabishii ano machi de kimi to kurasetara

Like where your voice seems to reach far while echoing in a zigzag fashion;
Like a place, where, if you look up, you seem to completely forget 
where you are in the flow of the clouds;
If I could live with you in that sad town...

  juugo no koro no suki-darake no
  boku ni warawarete
  kyou mo nemuri no sekai e to
  suberiochite iku

Being laughed at a myself from when I was 15 and full of openings (for attack),
today also I will go sliding down into the world of sleep.
