Nana e no kimochi
by Spitz

words by Kusano Masamune

Dare kara mo sukarete
Katahou ja sakerarete
Maeburenaku sakende
Hen na toko de morai naki
Tama ni sukoshi kuuru de
Genki nai tokya nemui dake
Daiji na koto wasurete itta

To be liked by somebody
To be avoided by the other one
Shout out without notice
Cry in sympathy in a strange place
Sometimes it's good to be a little cool
Without energy I'm just sleepy
I forgot something important

Garasu dama no piasu
Kirakira hikarasete 
Ocha nigosu kotoba de
Mawari o komarasete
Hi ni yaketa tsuyoi ude
Nemoto dake kuroi kami
Shiawase no katachi o kaeta

A glass bead earring
Glistening with light 
Spoil the tea with your words
Bothered by your surroundings
A tan muscled arm
Only the roots of the hair are black
Changed into a satisfied form

Dakara Nana kimi dake ga
Nana koko ni iru
Nana yume ga aru
Yobou mo aru
Tabun zutto

So Nana - you are
Nana - the only one here
Nana - I have dreams
And desires
Probably forever

Kaidouzoi no roiho de
Yoake made hanashikomi
Nani mo dekizu hoomu de
Miokurareru toki no
Nikutarashi egao
Yoku wakaranu teburi
Kimi to ikite iku koto o kimeta

Along the highway at the Royal Host
Deep in talk until the dawn
Doing nothing at the platform
Time to see you off
A hateful smile
Confusing gestures
I've decided to live with you

Dakara Nana kimi dake ga
Nana koko ni iru
Nana yume ga aru
Yobou mo aru
Tabun zutto

So Nana - you are
Nana - the only one here
Nana - I have dreams
And desires
Probably forever

Kaidouzoi no roiho de
Yoake made hanashikomi
Nani mo dekizu hoomu de
Miokurareru toki no
Nikutarashi egao
Yoku wakaranu teburi
Kimi to ikite iku koto o kimeta

Along the highway at the Royal Host
Deep in talk until the dawn
Doing nothing at the platform
Time to see you off
A hateful smile
Confusing gestures
I've decided to live with you
