    USAGI no BAIKU
    ("Rabbit bike") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  USAGI no BAIKU de nigedasou
  kareha wo maiagete
  yasashii ano ko mo tsurete ikou
  koori no oka wo koete

I run away on the rabbit bike,
making withered leaves fly up in the wind.
I'll take that nice girl with me,
passing over an icy hill.

  myakuhaku no okashina RIZUMU
  yorokobi ni afurenagara hora
  kakenukete ima nimo kowaresouna USAGI no BAIKU

The rhythm of a strange pulsation is heard,
while overflowing with joy, look!
Outrunning, the rabbit bike even now seems about to break.

Outrunning, the rabbit bike even now seems about to break.
