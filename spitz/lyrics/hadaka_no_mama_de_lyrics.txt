  Hadaka no mama de ("Naked as we are") 
    by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune


  hitori no yoru kuchibiru kande koori no heya wo tobidashita no sa
  hito wa daremo ga sabishigariya no SARU datte ima wakatta yo

On a night by myself, biting my lip, I flew out of a room of ice.
Now I've understood that people are all lonesome monkeys!

  hagarehajimeta uso ni tsuite REERU no ue de kangaeta no sa
  chiisana ZURU sae yurusarenai okite na noni meguriaeta yo

Telling a lie that started to come undone, I was thinking of it while
upon the rail.  Even though the rule cannot allow even a tiny cheat, 
I was able to run into you.

--

  soshite toki wa yukkuri nagaredasu
  futari koko ni iru hadaka no mama de
  donna ni tooku hanareteita tte kimi wo mitsumeteru
  hora hayaku hayaku kizuiteokure yo

And time flows leisurely on.
The two of us are here, naked as we are.
No matter how far apart you say we've been separated, I am watching you.
Look, hurry and notice it!

--

  chikadou ni hibiku kami no koe wo masuijuu katate ni oikaketa
  nakushita subete wo torimodosu no sa chi no soko ni mayoikonde mo

Carrying a tranqualizer rifle, I pursued the voice of God that 
rings in the underground tunnel.  I will restore everyting that 
was lost, even if I must wander to the depths of the earth!

--

  yagate hikari wa ayashiku terashidasu
  futari aruiteru michi wa nakute mo
  donna ni fukaku kiri ni tsutsumaretemo kimi wo mitsumeteru
  hora hayaku hayaku kizuiteokure yo

By and by, time flows leisurely on.
The two of us are walking, even though there is no road.
No matter how deeply we become enveloped in fog, I am watching you.
Look, hurry and notice it!

--

  soshite toki wa yukkuri nagaredasu
  futari koko ni iru hadaka no mama de
  yagate hikari wa ayashiku terashidasu
  futari aruiteru michi wa nakute mo
  donna ni tooku hanareteita tte kimi wo aishiteru
  hora hayaku hayaku kizuiteokure yo

And time flows leisurely on.
The two of us are here, naked as we are.
By and by, time flows leisurely on.
The two of us are walking, even though there is no road.
No matter how far apart you say we've been separated, I love you.
Look, hurry and notice it!
