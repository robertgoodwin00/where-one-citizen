     words by Kusano Masamune


  kimi ga sekai da to kizuita hi kara
  mune no daichi wa mawarihajimeta
  setsunai sora ni ukabeteita no sa
  kagerou mitai na futari no sugata o


From the day that I realized that you are the world
the Earth of my breast started to rotate.
We were indeed sent floating into the heart-wrenching sky,
our two ephemerical figures.

  sugu ni
  kizetsu shisou na omoi kara hanatarete

Suddenly being discharged from thoughts that seem about to faint..

  kimi ni furetai kimi ni furetai hinata no mado de
  tadayoinagara karamarinagara
  sore dake de ii nani mo iranai hitomi no oku e
  boku o shizumete kure

I want to touch you, I want to touch you by the sunny window
while drifting, while entangling.
That is all that I need, I need nothing else.
Sink me into the depths of your pupils.

  hinata no mado ni akogareteta n da
  kanashii koi no uta ni yurarete
  rakugaki darake no yume o miru no sa
  kaze no noizu de kezurarete yuku yo

I was longing for the sunny windowside,
for being swayed by the sad song of love.
I do see a dream smeared with graffiti.
It is being erased by the noise of the wind.

  itsumo
  boku no hoshii no wa yasashii uso janakute

What I always want is not some tender lie..

I want to touch you, I want to touch you by the sunny window
while drifting, while entangling.
That is all that I need, I need nothing else.
Sink me into the depths of your pupils.

  meriigoorando meriigoorando futari no meriigoorando
  meriigoorando meriigoorando futari no meriigoorando
  zutto kono mama zutto zutto

Merry-go-round Merry-go-round A Merry-go-round for the two of us
Merry-go-round Merry-go-round A Merry-go-round for the two of us
Continually, just like this, continually, continually
