  koi wa kinou yori mo utsukushii yuugure
  koi wa todokanai kanashiki terepashii
  koi wa machikirezu sakiisogu sakura
  koi wa yakitsuite hanarenai hitomi

Love is a sunset that is more beautiful each day.
Love is a sad telepathy that is not received.
Love is a 'sakura' flower that rapidly blooms without waiting.
Love is a pupil that you cannot separate from, that continually burns.

  chouchou ni naru kimi no itazura de
  tada akaku katachi naki yume o
  somete yuku you na yuugure

It is a sunset that just seems to dye shapeless dreams red
by the prank of your becoming butterflies.

  koi wa mayowazu ni nomu fukou no kusuri
  koi wa sasayaka na akuma e no inori
  
Love is a medicine of unhappiness that one drinks without hesitation.
Love is a whispered prayer to the devil.

Your echoing whisper is a sunset that just seems to 
dye shapeless dreams red.

  buki o sutete boku wa koko ni iru
  mabuta no uchigawa de ikiteiru
  kusuguru kaze ni hakobareru mama
  nagameta yuugure

With weapon thrown down, I am here.  
I am living on the inside of my own memory.
Being carried off by the tickling wind,
there is the sunset I watched.
