  kanashii hi ni wa atarashii uta
  hitotsu tooku arukidasou ka
  hare no yohou mo hazureta kedo
  akaku kasumu yuuhi o matou ka

On a sad day there is one new song.  
Shall we start walking far?  
The forecast of cleary skies was off but
shall we wait for the red hazy setting sun?

  afureru namida o fukinagara

Even if things look like trash, without throwing them out,
while wiping away the brimming tears...

  hitotsu tooku arukidasou ka

On a sad day there is one false song.  
Shall we start walking far?

  karada no dokoka de kanojo o omou
  mata aou to itta michi no ue

Somewhere in my body I think of her.
We said we'd meet again upon the road.
