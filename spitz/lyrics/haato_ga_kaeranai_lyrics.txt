   Haato ga Kaeranai
   ("My heart will not return") by Spitz

   words by Kusano Masamune


  kimi no hohoemi torimodosetara mou nanimo iranai to
  tsugou yosugiru sujigaki ukabenagara mata nemuru yo
  ikigaru dake de chuutohampa na ore wo chikuchiku shita
  ryoute hirogete ADORIBU de utaidashisou na haru datta

If I can recover your smile I won't need anything else.
Thinking that while a plan too convenient comes
into my head, I sleep again.
Just your wanting to go pricked this wishy-washy me.
It was a spring in which I could spread open my hands and 
sing ad-lib out loud.  

--

  are kara HAATO ga kaeranai
  tobideta HAATO ga kaeranai

Since then my heart will not return.
My heart that flew out will not return. 

--

  yasashii hito yo kiri ga haretara futari de JUUSU demo
  tsugou yosugiru sujigaki ukabenagara mata nemuru yo
  mata nemuru yo
  aa mou sukoshi dake

You are a gentle person.  After the fog clears we will drink juice
or something together the two of us.
While a plan too convenient comes into my head I sleep again.
I sleep again.
Ah, just a little more.
