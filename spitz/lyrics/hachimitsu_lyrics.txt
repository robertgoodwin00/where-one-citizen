        Hachimitsu
        ("Honey") by Spitz

        words by Kusano Masamune
        <The lyrics of this neat song do not translate so well 
        into English but you can get the basic idea>


  hitori munashiku bisuketto no shiketteru hibi o hete
  deatta kimi ga hajimete no kokoro sarakedaseru
  
With the lonely days of a futilely dampened biscuit decreasing
I meet you and expose my heart to you for the first time.

  suteki na koibito hachimitsu tokashiteyuku
  kogoeru koinu o atatamete
  natsukashii asobi ga yomigaeru no wa
  akari no basho made tsunawatari shita kara

The honey melts from handsome lovers,
thawing out the frozen little dog.
The reason old familiar fun will be reborn is that
they have walked the tightrope to a bright place.

  garakuta bakari piikooto no poketto ni shinobasete
  ijippari shai na onna no ko boku o niramitsukeru

Concealing it in a coat pocket filled with nothing but trash
the obstinate shy girl shoots a glare at me.

  okashi na koibito hachimitsu tokashityuku
  chouchou-musubi o hodoku you ni
  mezurashii hooseki ga hiroenai nara
  futari no kakera de ma ni awasete shimae

The honey melts from strange lovers,
as if the ribbon on the package is coming undone.
If they can not pick up the rare gem
the two pieces (of the two) come completely together.

  suteki na koibito hachimitsu tokashiteyuku
  akari no basho made tsunawatari shita kara

The honey melts from handsome lovers
because they have walked the tightrope to a bright place.
