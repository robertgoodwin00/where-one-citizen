    Haruka
    ("Distant") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune



  natsu no iro ni akogareteta FUTSUU no mainichi
  nagasaretari sakarattari tsuzuku hosoi michi
  kimi to meguriatte mou ichido SANAGI ni natta
  uso to hontoo no hazama de kiekaketa boku ga

On the normal everyday-ness longing for the color of summer,
a narrow road continues on flowing, and going against it.  
Having been around with you I have become a pupa (larva) again;
The me that started to fade away in a loophole of lies and truth.

  omoide kara tsugihagi shita kanashii DAIARII
  KAGI mo kakezu tabidatsu noha sukoshi kowai kedo
  oka no ue ni tatte ookiku kaze wo suikonde
  ima kokoro kara ieru yo NIOI sou na   I LOVE YOU

Not locking up the sad diary patched from memories
and setting forth on a journey is a little bit scary, but
standing at the top of a hill I breath the wind in deeply.  
I can say it from my heart now, a fragrant "I love you"!

  sugu ni tobesou na ki ga shita senaka
  yume kara samenai tsubasa

My back gets the feeling that it can suddenly fly.
My wings do not wake up from the dream.

  toki no yohaku nuritsubushita akubi no ato de
  "shiawase" toka yabo na kotoba mune ni daita mama de
  kuzuresou na mirai wo hadashi de kakenukeru you na
  sonna uraWAZA mo nai kedo ashita niha kitto...

After a crushed and smeared yawn in the gap of time
I keep embracing to my chest senseless words like "happiness". 
As if outrunnning by bare feet a future that is about to crumble--
There isn't that kind of back-handed trick, but tomorrow for sure....

--

  bokura sorezore aogimiru sora
  yume kara samenai tsubasa

We look up respectively to the sky.  
Our wings do not wake up from the dream. 

--

  tobesou na ki ga shita senaka
  yume kara samenai tsubasa

My back gets the feeling that it can fly.
My wings do not wake up from the dream.  

--

  sorezore aogimiru sora
  yume kara samenai tsubasa

We look up respectively to the sky.  
Our wings do not wake up from the dream.

  tooi tooi haruka na basho e

To a distant distant place.
