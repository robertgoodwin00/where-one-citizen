   words by Kusano Masamune


  kimagure kimi wa KYUUTO na hayate
  taoresou na karada o kakenuketa
  kotoba wa yagate koi no jama o shite
  sorezore kagi o hyakko mo tsuketa

Whimsical you are a gust of wind.
You ran past a body about to collapse.
Words will shortly be getting in the way of love.
I tried each of one hundred keys.

  demo aitai kimochi dake ga fukurande waresou sa
  machigatte mo ii yo

But just the feeling of wanting to see her swells
and is about to burst.
It's all right even if I'm wrong!

  nantonaku kimi no koe ga kikoete
  harikitte HAATO o zenbu narabete
  kakkoyoku narihibiita kuchibue
  furimuku tokoro de me ga sameta

More or less hearing your voice
I am in high spirits and our hearts are all arranged.
A cool whistling rings out.
Just when I turn around your eyes have opened.

It's just that I'm thinking of nothing but the smiling Cupid. 
If I could plunge into...

  haresou de kumori mainichi kosame
  mou nido to kowasenai ki ga shiteta

Every day looks like it will clear up, cloudy and with drizzles.  
I got the feeling I can't break it ever again.
