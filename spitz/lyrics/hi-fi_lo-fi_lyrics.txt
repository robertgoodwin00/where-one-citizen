    words by Kusano Masamune


  Fly High! amai sasayaki nimo FURAFURA to
  HAIFUAI ROOFUAI ore wa sore wo ai to yobu yo
  OK! doukei KIBIshii toki mo aru keredo
  HAIFUAI ROOFUAI ore wa sore wo ai to yobu yo

Fly high!  Even to a weak whisper unsteadily
Hi-fi Lo-fi,  I call that love!
Okay!  Yearnings, and tight times will also come, but
Hi-fi Lo-fo,  I call that love!

  daremo karemo II koto iu ga
  kaketa yuuhi ga mieru darou?
  atsuki SOURU ketobashite kyou mo
  oikaketeyuku

Everyone speaks of good things but
can you see the setting sun after it has waned?
Kicking off this feverish soul, today also
we go on chasing.

  Ride on! maido KAWAII dake de daisuki sa
  HAIFUAI ROOFUAI ore wa sore wo ai to yobu yo

Ride on! Each time I love your just being cute.
Hi-fi Lo-fo,  I call that love!

  saa nigero shiroi kabe tsukiyabutte
  hone no oto ga sora ni hibiku made

So then, run away, breaking through a white wall
until the sound of bone rings through the air.

  MUDA na koto ga koboresou demo
  koobi no tame no sei janaku
  atsuki SOURU ketobashite kyou mo
  oikaketeyuku

Even when futile things seems about to spill over,
it is not to be alive for the sake of mating.
Kicking off this feverish soul, today also
we go on chasing.

  OK! doukei KIBIishii toki mo aru keredo
  HAIFUAI ROOFUAI ore wa sore wo ai to yobu yo

Okay!  Yearnings, and tight times will also come, but
Hi-fi Lo-fo,  I call that love!
