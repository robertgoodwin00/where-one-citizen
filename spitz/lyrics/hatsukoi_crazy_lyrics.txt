Hatsukoi Crazy 
(Hatsukoi is the first person you ever fell in love with)
by Spitz
Words by Kusano Masamune

Minareta hazu no machi nami mo
Do hade ni utsusu orokamono
Kimi no se de okikunatta mirai

We were supposed to be used to the look and feel of the city
And the fools who project their gaudy reflection.
It's your fault that the future has become so big.

Yume no sekai to urahara no
Kurushi magire hitori goto mo
Wasurerareta aisu no youni toketa

Speaking to myself in desperation of the world that is opposite my dreams.
Just like melted ice, forgotten.

Darekare sukima o nukete
Okashina himitsu no basho e
Kimi to iku no sa mayowazu ni
Kotoba ni dekinai kimochi hitasura tsutaeru chikara
Omote no imi o koete yaru sore dake de

Somebody slipped through the cracks
To that strange secret place.
I will go with you. Honestly.
Feelings I can't put into words.
Earnestly with the ability to convey,
To cross over the surface of the meaning, it's only that.

Karui beze de mitasarete
Tooboeshiteta tsunehigoro
Chigau shiki wa atto iu mani sugite

I feel satisfied with your light kiss.
Howling as always
The different seasons passed us by just like that.

Kokoro no puropera mawasu
Bakageta himitsu no basho e
Yakusoku dayo ne
Futari kiri

The propellers in my heart are turning.
Just the two of us to that ridiculously secret place.
It's a promise.

Yasashiku narenai tokimo
Yasashiku sarenai tokimo
Kakureta sora wa aoi daro
Ima no ma ma

There are times when you can't be kind.
There are times when you won't be kind.
The hidden sky is still blue
Just like it is now.

Naki mushi ni naru
Usotsuki ni naru
Hoshi ni negatte mo
Tatoeba boku ga
Modorenai hodo ni kowarete ite mo

Become a crybaby
Become a liar
Even if you wish on a star.
What if I am broken so that I can't come back.

Darekare sukima o nukete
Okashina himitsu no basho e
Kimi to iku no sa mayowazu ni
Kotoba ni dekinai kimochi hitasura tsutaeru chikara
Omote no imi o koete yaru sore dake de
Koete yaru sore dake de

Somebody slipped through the cracks
To that strange secret place.
I will go with you. Honestly.
Feelings I can't put into words.
Earnestly with the ability to convey,
To cross over the surface of the meaning, it's only that.
To cross over, it's only that.
