    Majo-tabi ni Deru
   ("Will go on a witch-trip") by Spitz

   words by Kusano Masamune

   
  hora ichigo no aji ni niteru yo
  mou mayou koto mo nai
  boku wa hitori inorinagara
  tabidatsu kimi o miteru yo
  te o hanashitara sugu
  neko no kao de utatte yaru
  
See, it resembles the taste of strawberry.
While a myself that no longer goes astray is praying alone,
I am watching you depart on a journey.
After I have released your hand I immediately
sing to you with a cat's face.

  rarara nakanaide
  rarara ikanukucha
  itsudemo koko ni iru kara ne

Lalala Don't cry.
Lalala You must go.
I'll always be here, you know.

  ima garasu no hoshi ga kiete mo
  sora takaku kaita monji
  itsuka kimi o terasu darou
  yuganda kagami no mukou ni
  wasureteta michi ga aru
  saa madara no kutsu o sutete

Even if the glass stars fade away now,
the letters written high in the sky
may someday shine on you. 
In the direction of the distorted mirror
there is a path that you have been forgetting.  
Well then, throw off your speckled shoes.

Lalala You must go.
I'll always be here, you know.
