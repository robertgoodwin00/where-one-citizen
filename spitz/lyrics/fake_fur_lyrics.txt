You had a gentle heart when I met you for the first time.
I thought you would change a little; it was like a dream.
Ticklish words that slide off of your lips...
Like even if it was all a lie that would be okay.

  akogare dake hikizutte detarame ni michi aruita
  kimi no namae sagashi motometeita tadoritsuite

Being dragged by only my yearning I walked the streets randomly.
I was searching for your name, and finding my way to you.

  wakachiau mono wa nani mo nai kedo
  koi no yorokobi ni afureteru

We have nothing to share but
we are overflowing with the joy of love.

Entrusting our bodies to the ocean of deceit
we are overflowing with the joy of love.

  ima kara hako no soto e futari wa hako no soto e

From now we are going outside of the box.
The two of us are going outside of the box.
I get the feeling that I have found my future and another world.
