     Tsuki ni kaeru 
     ("Return to the moon") by Spitz

     words by Kusano Masamune



  makka na tsuki ga yobu  boku ga umareta tokoro sa
  doko darou
  kiiroi tsuki ga yobu kimi ga umareta tokoro sa
  shimetta kibako no naka de

The crimson moon calls.  It's the place where I was born.
Where could it be?
The yellow moon calls.  It's the place where you were born,
inside a dampened wooden box.

  meguriaeta mitai da ne
  kyou no hi yukai ni sugiteyuku
  mou sayonara da yo kimi no koto ha wasurenai

It seems we happened upon eachother, didn't we.
We shall spend today cheerfully.
It's goodbye; I will not forget you.

  makka na tsuki ga yobu daremo shiranai tooku de
  hikatteiru
  kiiroi tsuki ga yobu daremo shiranai tooku de
  hodoketa hadaka no ito de
  
The crimson moon calls.  Far off where nobody knows,
it's shining.
The yellow moon calls, far off where nobody knows,
on a naked thread that has come loose.

  meguriaeta mitai da ne
  kyou no hi kirei ni sugiteyuku
  mou sayonara da yo kimi no koto ha wasurenai

It seems we happened upon eachother, didn't we.
We shall spend today prettily.
It's goodbye; I will not forget you.
