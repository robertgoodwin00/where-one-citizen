As I near the peak of this hill, foolish lies seem also to fade away,
after I have engraved in my mind this season that I love that is coming shortly.
With a splendid chord at just the right time it seems to reach to a tremendous height.
More than words I seek contact towards a rushing you.

Like powder flying out, it's a  stifling heart-throbbing.
This moment only I do not run away but stay gazing at you. 
On a reckless and serious night for some reason I feel I'm going to cry.
Even while happiness is paused, it will continue.

For even a lost monkey, if he feels good, tomorrow he will be able to laugh.
If you look back you are starving for tenderness in a tender era.

The start of a dream still has a sort of sweet taste.
It is good to carry fragile items in your arms, isn't it?
The light from an ancient star shines on us.
It will be from now on since the time that there was nothing in the world.

If I entrust the scraps of my heart to the cloud that drifts 
with the south-bound wind, far off...
