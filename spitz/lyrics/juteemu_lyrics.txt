     Juteemu? ("I love you?")

     words by Kusano Masamune

  ureshii nukumori ni tsutsumareru tame
  ikutsumo no machigai kasuneteru
  juteemu? baka da yone
  
So that you can be enveloped in happy warmth 
you pile up mistake after mistake.
I love you?  That's foolish.  

--

  betsu ni kamawanai to kimi wa iu kedo
  tekitou na kotoba ga mitsukaranai
  juteemu... sonna toko da

You say you don't particularly care but
you can't find the proper words to say.
I love you...  That's about where we are.   

--

  kimi ga iru no wa suteki na koto da
  yasashiku naru nanimokamo

Your being here is a wonderful thing.
Everything makes it sweeter.  

--

  KAREE no nioi ni sasowareru you ni
  yuuyami wo kakedasu ikimono ga
  juteemu!  kore kara mo

Like being tempted by the smell of curry
a living thing runs out into the twilight.
I love you!  From here on also...

--

  kimi ga iru no wa ikenai koto da
  nayamitsukareta kyou mo mata

Your being here will not do.
Today again I am tired from worrying.

--

  kimi ga iru no wa suteki na koto da
  yasashiku naru nanimokamo

Your being here is a wonderful thing.
Everything makes it sweeter.  

--

  kimi ga iru no wa ikenai koto da
  nayamitsukareta kyou mo mata

Your being here will not do.
Today again I am tired from worrying.
