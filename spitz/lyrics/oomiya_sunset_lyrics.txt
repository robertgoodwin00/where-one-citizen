   Oomiya SANSETTO
   ("Sunset over Oomiya") by Spitz

   words by Kusano Masamune


  kono machi de ore igai ni kimi no kawaisa wo shiranai
  ima no tokoro ore igai ni kimi no kawaisa wo shiranai hazu
 
In this town I know of noone with your charm other than me.
At this moment I ought to know of noone with your charm other than me.

  oomiya SANSETTO kimi wa naze kanashii me de hohoemu
  oomiya SANSETTO te wo tsunaide aruku doyoubi

Oomiya sunset.  Why do you smile with sad eyes?
Oomiya sunset.  On a saturday that we walk holding hands.

  chiisana koto ga kigakari de nando mo kurikaeshi kangaeru
  yasashii zatsuon ni mimi sumase muriyari me wo tojite kangaeru

Small things making me anxious, I ponder over and over again.
Listening carefully to gentle background noise I force my eyes closed and think.

  ano oomiya SANSETTO myou ni dekai ne chiisana sekai wo terasu
  oomiya SANSETTO shouki ja nai ze mada koko ni ite

That Oomiya sunset is strangely large, isn't it.  It shines on this tiny world.
Oomiya sunset.  We are not in our right minds.  Stay here yet.  

--

  kimi wo dakishimetai yo konya ore wa nenai yo
  kitai-hazure no hibi wo nurikaeteiku sube wo shiru

I want to embrace you!  Tonight I won't be sleeping!
I know a way that we can repaint the days that didn't go according to expectations.

  ano oomiya SANSETTO myou ni dekai ne chiisana sekai wo terasu
  oomiya SANSETTO shouki ja nai ze mada koko ni ite

That Oomiya sunset is strangely large, isn't it.  It shines on this tiny world.
Oomiya sunset.  We are not in our right minds.  Stay here yet.
