  Ore no Subete 
  ("My everything") by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune


  moeru you na ABANCHUURU usui mune wo kogasu
  kore ga ore no subete

An adventure like on fire burns in my faint chest.
This is my everything.

  arukitsukarete hetarikondara gakeppuchi
  hohoemu you ni shiroi nogiku ga saiteita
  
Too tired to walk I sank exhausted by the brink of a cliff.
White wild chrysantemums are blossoming as if they are smiling.

  kokoro no hida ni hasanda mono ha kakusanakute mo ii to
  kawa no mannaka hikaru sakana ga odokeru you ni hajiketeru

Brilliant fish spring about in the middle of the stream as if jesting,
telling me it's okay not to hide what is held between a pleat of my heart.

--

  moeru you na ABANCHUURU usui mune wo kogasu
  soshite kyou mo shizumu yuuhi wo se ni ukete

An adventure like on fire burns in my faint chest.
And today also I let the setting sun shine on my back.

--

  ore no zense ha tabun SAGIshi ka majinaishi
  taguriyosereba doitsu mo nita you na kao bakari
  
In my previous life I may have been a swindler or a magician.
If I haul them in close they resemble nothing but German faces.

--

  dekai PAZURU no achira-kochira ni egakikomareta RUURU
  kiekaketa KIZU kakimushiru hodo oroka na koi ni oboretara 

All over a huge puzzle there are rules inscribed.
The more I scratch at a wound faded away, if I drown in foolish love... 

--

  moeru you na ABANCHUURU ashi no yubi mo sawagu
  manatsu yori mo atsuku awai yume no naka de

An adventure like on fire; even my toes cry out.
It's hotter even than midsummer in the middle of a fleeting dream.

--

  nanimo shiranai omae to fureteru dake no KISU wo suru
  sore dake de hanashi ha owaru tokete nagareteku

I give you, who knows nothing, a kiss of touching only.
With just that the talk ends.  Melting, it flows on.

--

  moeru you na ABANCHUURU usui mune wo kogasu
  soshite kyou mo shizumu yuuhi wo se ni ukete
  yama no you na JANKUFUUZU ishi no heya de nemuru
  nokorimono saguru kore ga ore no subete

An adventure like on fire burns in my faint chest.
And today also I let the setting sun shine on my back.
I will sleep in a rock room with a mountain's worth of junk food.
I will search for what remains.  This is my everything.
