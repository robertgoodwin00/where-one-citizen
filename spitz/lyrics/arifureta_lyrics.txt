Arifureta Jinsei - An ordinary life

Music & Lyrics by Kusano Masamune
Translation by Jody Powton

arifureta jinsei wo sagashite ita
kizu tsukitakunai kara
kimi to iru jikan ha mijikasugite
raishuu made motsu ka na

I have been searching for an ordinary life in order for me to not get hurt.
The times I spend with you are always too short. Maybe I will hold you here with me until next week.


aa, kokoro ga shioresou, aitai
mou mate nai, kore ijou, mate nai
soshite kyou mo mata nemurenai

Ah, I want to meet you. My heart is fading away.
All because of this I cannot wait any longer.
And again today I cannot sleep.


karamawaru gambari de yurusareteta
genjitsu ha kowai na
nigekomeru itsumono chiisana heya
tenmetsu suru irotachi

With my effort going round in circles, I have now been allowed,
The fact is that it is pretty scary. 
I can always seek refuge in this small room,
With all the blinking colours.


aa, tokidoki, kikoeru, ano koe
mou mate nai, kore ijou, mate nai
moji wo me de otte
mata hajime kara

Ah, sometimes I can hear that voice,
All because of this I cannot wait any longer.
It will start again so we shall follow the writings with our eyes

aa, aitai, yume demo, aitai
mou mate nai, kore ijou, mate nai
wakatteiru kedo kawarenai

Ah, I want to meet you. Even if it’s a dream, I want to meet you.
All because of this I can’t wait any longer.
I understand but it won’t change.
