  Kimi o wasurenai magarikunetta michi o yuku
  Umaretate no taiyou to yume o wataru kiniroi suna
  Nido to modorenai kusuguriatte korogeta hi
  kitto souzou shita ijou ni sawagashii mirai ga boku o matteru

I walk down the winding path of not forgetting you.
The golden sand that crosses dreams and the newborn sun;
The day that will never return in which 
we tickled eachother and tumbled down;
Certainly an exciting future beyond what I have imagined
is waiting for me.

  'Aishiteru' no hibiki dake de tsuyoku nareru ki ga shita yo
  sasayaka na yorokobi o tsubureru hodo dakishimete

Just with the sound of the words "I love you" I got 
the feeling I can become stronger,
hugging the tiny joy so hard it is crushed.

  koboresou na omoi yogoreta te de kakiageta
  ano tegami wa sugu ni demo sutete hoshii to itta noni
  sukoshi dake nemui tsumetai mizu de kojiakete
  ima sekasareru you ni tobasareru you ni toorisugiteku

Even though I told you I wanted you to throw it out right away,
that letter which contained my emotions that seemed to spill out
and was written by a dirty hand,
just a little sleepy, waking up with cold water,
now, like being rushed, like being blown out, I pass through.

  'Aishiteru' no hibiki dake de tsuyoku nareru ki ga shita yo
  Itsuka mata kono basho de kimi to meguriaitai

Just with the sound of the words "I love you" I got 
the feeling I can become stronger.
Some time again I want to go around with you in this place.

  Donna ni aruite mo tadoritsukenai
  kokoro no yuki de nureta hoho
  akuma no furi shite kirisaita uta o 
  haru no kaze ni mau hanapira ni kaete

The cheek wet from the snow of the heart I
cannot reach no matter how far I walk, 
acting like the Devil, change the torn song
to a flower petal that dances in the Spring wind.

  'Aishiteru' no hibiki dake de tsuyoku nareru ki ga shita yo
  Sasayaka na yorokobi o tsubureru hodo dakishimete
  Zuru shite mo majime ni mo ikite yukeru ki ga shita yo
  Itsuka mata kono basho de kimi to meguriaitai

Just with the sound of the words "I love you" I got 
the feeling I can become stronger,
hugging the tiny joy so hard it is crushed. 
Whether with slyness or with seriousness I got
the feeling I can go on living.
Some time again I want to go around with you in this place.
