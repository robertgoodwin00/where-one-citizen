    She-she!! ("Thanks!!")
     by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  owaru koto nado nai no da to tsuyoku omoikondereba
  dareka no sei ni shinakute mo dounika yatte ikemasu
  yarinaoshite mo yoi no desu kondo wa hitoribocchi demo
  kigouka sareta kono heya kara tsuini tabidatte ikun desu

If I am able to convince myself strongly that it isn't over or anything
I can go on somehow without putting blame on anyone.  
It is all right to start over.  This time, even though I may be lonely, 
I finally set out on a journey from this room with its number changed.

  itsu demo yasashii kimi ni she-she!! otona mo kodomo mo naku
  namida de gomakashitari imi mo naku dakiau bokura
  ima koko ni iru

To a you that was at any time nice to me--Thanks!  
Adult or child, it doesn't matter.
With tears, misunderstanding meanings that don't matter either,
hugging eachother, we are here now.

  umareru tame ni aru no desu jikani sawareru youna
  atarashii hitotsu hitotsu e to nanimokamo kanashii hodo ni

It is there for the sake of being born; like something you can touch directly.
We go from one new thing to the next, to the extent that everything becomes sad.

  aku made yasashii kimi ni she-she! akai tsuchi nimo me fuita
  oozora ni tokesouni nari hora subete kirihanasareru
  tori yori mo jiyuuni kanari arinomama kimi wo miteiru

To a you that was persistently nice to me--Thanks! 
A bud sways even while in the red earth.
Becoming as if it will melt in the heavens, look, everything is separated apart.
Free-er than a bird, and with considerable frankness, I am looking at you.

  atarashii hitotsu hitotsu e to nanimo kamo kanashii hodo ni

It is there for the sake of being born; like something you can touch directly.
We go from one new thing to the next, to the extent that everything becomes sad.

  aku made yasashii kimi ni she-she! akai tsuchi nimo me fuita
  oozora ni tokesou ni nari hora subete kirihanasareru
  kusudama ga warete waraigoe no naka kimi wo miteiru

To a you that was persistently nice to me--Thanks! 
A bud sways even while in the red earth.
Becoming as if it will melt in the heavens, look, everything gets separated apart.
A decorated ball cracks open, and in the midst of a laughing voice, 
I am looking at you.
