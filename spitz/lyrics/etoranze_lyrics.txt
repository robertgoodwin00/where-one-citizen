    Etoranze
    ("a stranger") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  me wo tojite sugu ukabiagaru hito
  umigame no koro surechigatta dake no

Closing my eyes, the person who comes to my head is
someone of the time of the sea turtle, that was only passing by. 

--

  narenai machi wo oyogu mou ichido 
  yami mo shiroi yoru

I swim through an unfamiliar town one more time.
This night even darkness is white.

I swim through an unfamiliar town one more time.
This night even darkness is white.
