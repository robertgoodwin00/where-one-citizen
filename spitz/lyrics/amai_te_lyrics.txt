  Amai Te ("Sweet Hand")
  by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune


  tooku kara kimi wo miteita
  itsumo yori akarui yoru datta
  yukkuri to ayumi wo tomete
  kotoba mo kigou mo wasurete

I was watching you from far away.  
It was a night brighter than usual.  
Slowly stopping the pace
forget words and signs.
 
--

  hajime kara hajime kara nanimonai
  dakara ima amai te de boku ni furete

From the beginning, from the beginning there is nothing.
So touch me with your sweet hand.  

--

  tooku kara kimi wo miteita
  hansha suru hikari ni magireta
  aisareru koto wo shiranai
  massugu na inu ni naritai

I was watching you from far away,
confused in the reflected light.
I want to become a straight dog 
that knows not what it is like to be loved.

  kurikaeshi kurikaeshi tanoshimi ni
  hi wo tsunagu amai te de boku ni furete
  
Repetition, repetition, taking pleasure in...
Touch me with your sweet hand that fastens the day.

  kurikaeshi kurikaeshi tanoshimi ni
  hi wo tsunagu amai te de boku ni furete
  
Repetition, repetition, taking pleasure in...
Touch me with your sweet hand that fastens the day.
