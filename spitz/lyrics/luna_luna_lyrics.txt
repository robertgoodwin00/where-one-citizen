    Luna Luna 
    by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


Wasurerarenai chiisai na itami kodoku no chikara de oyogi kiri
Kasumi no mukou ni sugu ni kiesouna shiroi hana
omoitsukarete saigo ha koko de nanimo shiranai hachi ni nareru
hitomi no ana-ki- nejiredasu toki kimi ga iru
--
The small, unforgettable pain of only swimming in the power of loneliness 
Across the mist, a white flower that appears as if it will soon vanish
The end of my tired thoughts is here - I can turn into an unknowing bee
A pupil anarchist, warped out times - You're there
--
futari de karamatte yume kara koboretemo mada toberu yo
atarashii tokimeki wo marugoto nusumu made, Luna Luna *
--
Even if I dropped from this dream of the two of us entwined, I could still fly
Until this new heart-throbbing is stolen in whole, Luna, Luna...
--
hitsuji no yoru wo bi-ru de arau tsumetai kabe ni motareteruyo
chakashiteru spu-ki- midara de amai aku no uta
--
I wash the night of sheep in beer, leaning against a cold wall
A teasing "spooky", an evil song with a lewd sweetness
--
kono mama tomenaide zawameki sakenaide hora mabushii
fushigi na dekigoto ha kimi he to tsuzuiteru, Luna Luna
--
Don't stop this moment, don't avoid the noise- over there, dazzling
A mysterious occurence- Following you, Luna, Luna...
