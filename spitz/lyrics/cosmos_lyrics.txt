Cosmos
by Spitz

words by Kusano Masamune

Azayaka na sayonara Eien no sayonara
Oimotometa mochifu wa doko
Maboroshi ni mo aezu sore demo sagashiteita kyou made no sabaku

Goodbye so vivid, goodbye forever.
Where is the motif I was after.
Even without seeing the phantom I kept searching untill today, a desert.
 
Yakusoku no umi made Boroboro no supotsuka
Hitori de yuku kuroru no gogo
Kimi no tsumetai te o Atatameta ano hi kara te ni ireta furyoku

With that worn out sports car untill the promised ocean
Alone I crawled to the afternoon.
From that day I warmed your cold hands I became boyant.

Sasayaku hikari abite tatsu kimi o mita aki no hi
Sabishige na mahiru no tsuki to nishi kaze ni
Yurete saku kosumosu nido to kaerenai

Standing, bathing in the whispering light that autumn noon I saw you.
That sad afternoon moon and the swaying west wind
The blooming cosmos, never to return again.

Azayaka na sayonara Eien no sayonara
Oimotometa mochifu wa doko
Maboroshi ni mo aezu sore demo sagashiteita kyou made no sabaku

Goodbye so vivid, goodbye forever.
Where is the motif I was after.
Even without seeing the phantom I kept searching untill today, a desert.

Ano hi no mama no aki no sora kimi ga ikiteta nara
Kasukana mahiru no tsuki to nishi kaze ni
Yurete saku kosumosu nido to kaerenai

That noonday autumn sky, if only you were still alive.
That faint midday moon and the swaying west wind
The blooming cosmos, never to return again.

Azayaka na sayonara Eien no sayonara
Oimotometa mochifu wa doko
Maboroshi ni mo aezu sore demo sagashiteita kyou made no sabaku

Goodbye so vivid, goodbye forever.
Where is the motif I was after.
Even without seeing the phantom I kept searching untill today, a desert.
