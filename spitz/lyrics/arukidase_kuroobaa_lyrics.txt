    Arukidase, Kurooba ("Walk out, clover")
      by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  michi no PEEJI nurikaerareru SUTOORI kaze ni mukai
  arukidase wakakute aoi KUROOBAA hadashi no mama de
  sugita koi no IMEEJI ni chikai MAAKU yubi de egaki
  nagaredasu jiyuu de hageshii MERODEI hitorikiri de
 
It is a story repainted on an unkown page; I face the wind.
Walk out, there are young green clovers under your bare feet.
With my finger I draw a mark that is close to an image of spent love.
All alone, a melody that is violent and free drifts out.

  sentouki yorimo akarasama na
  kimi no koe yasashii ENAJII

Your voice that is more plain than a war machine;
it is tender energy.

--

  arukidase KUROOBAA tomaranai KUROOBAA
  atsui nageKISSU uketomeru sora

Walk out, clover.  Don't stop, clover.
The hotly thrown kiss; the sky that receives it.  

--

  nakinagara waraidashi "ureshii!" to nandomo sakebi
  nekorogatte nagameta kimi no KAADO mune ni ateru
  
Laughing with a shout of "I'm happy!" over and over while crying,
I want to lie down, putting the card of you that I had gazed at to my breast.

  nyuudoukumo kara tsutaeteiru
  sono mama de yasashii ENAJII

It is conveyed from a summer cloud.
Just like that, it is tender energy.

  dandan wakattekita no sa
  mienai basho de tsukurareta nami ni
  kezuritorareteyuku inochi ga
  konton no iro ni akogare kanzen ni chigau katachi de
  kiekaketa kemono no michi wo aruiteyuku

Graduallly I've come to understand it.
My life that goes on being eroded away by a 
wave that was created at a place I cannot see
longs for the color of chaos.  In a completely different form
I go on walking down a path for beasts that has started to fade away.

--

  kimi no koe yasashii ENAJII
  arukidase KUROOBAA tomaranai KUROOBAA
  atsui nageKISSU uketomeru sora

Your voice is tender energy.
Walk out, clover.  Don't stop, clover.
The hotly thrown kiss; the sky that receives it.
