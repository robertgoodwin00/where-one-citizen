    Mizuiro no Machi 
    "A water colour town" 


  Kawa wo wataru, kimi ga sumu machi e, 
  aitakute, ima sugu, tobihameru kokoro de, 
  mizuiro no ano machi e, 

Crossing a river, to a town that you live in, 
to meet you, right now, with a pounding heart, 
to that water coloured town, 
~~~~~ 

Ra ra ra... 

~~~~~ 
  Yasashikunatte, puresento motte, 
  aitakute, ima sugu, machigaeta sutepu de, 
  mizuiro no ano machi e, 

Becoming gentle, holding that present, 
wanting to meet you, right now, with the wrong step, 
to that water coloured town, 
~~~~~ 

Ra ra ra... 

~~~~~ 
  Kubi no nioi, akarui to hitomi, 
  aitakute, ima sugu, doromamire no kutsu de, 
  mizuiro no ano machi e, 

The smell of your neck, with bright eyes, 
wanting to meet you, right now, with muddy shoes, 
to that water coloured town, 
~~~~~ 

  Kawa wo wataru, kimi ga sumu machi e, 
  aitakute, ima sugu, tobihameru kokoro de, 
  mizuiro no ano machi e, 

Crossing a river, to a town that you live in, 
to meet you, right now, with a pounding heart, 
to that water coloured town.
