    Tori ni Natte ("Become a bird")
     by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune

 
  ima tori ni natte tori ni natte kimi wa tori ni natte
  tori ni natte tori ni natte boku wo tsureteitte
  boku wo tsureteitte
  aa itsumade kimi no karada ni shigamitsuita mama
  kitto ashita wa bokura wa sora ni naru
  
Become a bird now.  Become a bird.  You become a bird.  
Become a bird.  Become a bird.  Take me along.  
Take me along.
Ah, for how long I will stay clung to you?
Certainly tomorrow we will become the sky.

This kind of thing also exists.
This kind of thing also exists.  
I will continue on talking like this.

  konna boku ni datte boku ni datte hokoreru mono ga aru
  mogura ni natte mogura ni natte boku ni shinobikonde
  koko ni shinobikonde
  aa kakugo ga dekinai mama de boku wa ikiteiru
  kuroi hedoro no dango no ue ni sumu

Even for this me, even for me there is something to be proud of.
Become a mole.  Become a mole.  Sneak into me.
Sneak in here.
Ah, I am alive without being prepared.  
I will live above a dark-sludged dumpling.

  waraibanashi janai ne

  kono mama boku wa shaberitsuzuketeru

It's not a tale to laugh at.
It's not a tale to laugh at.
I will continue on talking like this.
