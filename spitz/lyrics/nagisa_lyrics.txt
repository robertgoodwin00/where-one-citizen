    Nagisa
    ("The beach") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune
		

  sasayaku joudan de itsumo tsunagari o shinjiteita
  sabaku ga tooku miesou na toki mo
  boyaketa rokutousei dakedo omoikomi no koi ni ochita
  hajimete puraido no saku o koete
  
I've always believed in the connection that comes via a whispered joke,
even when the desert seems to be far off.
It is a dim sixth-grade star, but I fell into this love,
crossing over the fence of pride for the first time.

  kaze no you na uta todoketai yo
  yasei no nokoribi daite suashi de hashireba
  
I want to deliver a song like the wind.
If I run with bare feet, embracing a wild flickering flame…

  yawarakai hibi ga nami no oto ni somaru
  maboroshi yo samenaide

Tender days are imbued in the sound of waves.
It's a vision.  Don't wake up from it.

---

  nejimageta omoide mo suterarezu ikite kita
  girigiri mousou dake de kimi to
  
I've come to live without throwing out the crooked memories.
On only thin delusions, with you...

---

  mizu ni natte zutto nagareru yo
  ikitsuita sono basho de saigo da toshite mo
  
We become water and flow continually
at that place that we have reached, even if it is for the last time...

---

  yawarakai hibi ga nami no oto ni somaru
  maboroshi yo samenaide
  nagisa wa futari no yume o mazeawaseru
  yurenagara kagayaite
  kagayaite...
  kagayaite...
  
Tender days are imbued in the sound of waves.
It's a vision.  Don't wake up from it.
The beach mixes our dreams together, shining while wavering.
Shining...
Shining...
