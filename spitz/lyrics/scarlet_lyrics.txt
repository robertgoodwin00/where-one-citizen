     words by Kusano Masamune


  hanasanai kono mama toki ga nagarete mo
  hitotsu dake chiisana akai hi o mamoritsuzukete iku yo
  yorokobi kanashimi kokoro yugamete mo
  samugari na futari o atatamete mujaki na mama no netsu de

Even if time drifts on this way without release,
I'll go on protecting just this one small flame.
Even if our hearts distort between joy and sadness,
with an ever innocent heat it will give warmth to this coldish couple.


  midaretobu koe ni kakikesarete koohii no uzu ni tokesou demo
  yurameku kagerou no mukou kara kimi ga te o nobashitara
 
Becoming erased by a dispursing voice,
seeming to melt in the swirl of a cup of coffee,
if you stretch your hand from the direction of the swaying ephemera


  hanasanai yasashiku dakishimeru dake de
  nanimokamo wasureteirareru yo hokori mamire no machi de

Just by hugging you gently without release
I am able to forget all, in this town covered with dust


  darenimo iezu ni yume miteita kuzureochisou na kotoba sae
  arinomama subete butsukete mo kimi wa hohoemu ka naa

I was seeing a dream without telling anyone,
words that seem about to crumble apart.
Even if you run into everything as it is, I wonder if you will smile?
