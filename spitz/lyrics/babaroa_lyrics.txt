    BABAROA by Spitz
    ("Bavarois", a kind of cake)

    words by Kusano Masamune 


  kagayaku tame no nisemono sa   dakara ore ha toberu
  sugu nimo kiesou na hoshi hitotsu yurete   tabi ha tsuduku
  
It's a counterfeit made to glitter.  And that's why I can fly.
A single star soon about to fade flickers.  The journey continues.

  mada kowarenaide yo  yawaraka na moufu wo tsubasa ni kaeru

Don't destroy it yet!  I will change a soft blanket into wings.

--
  
  odoroite hoshii dake no miesuita karaburi
  NAIIBU de zatsu na DORAMA
  motto buzama na yarikata de uchuu no hada ni fureru
  BABAROA ai ni iku kara

A transparent move intended only to surprise;
It's a naive and course drama.
With more clumsiness I touch the skin of the universe.
'Cause I'm going to see Bavarois.

--

  oku no hou ni atta kizuato mo ima ha soto ni sarasu
  yami wo hau kaze ga naiteita   zutto naiteita
  
The hidden scar I now expose to the outside.
The wind crawling through the night was crying.  Continually it was crying.

--

  chakuchi suru hi made atataki uso mo sutenaideiru
  
Until the day I land, I will not be throwing away even a hot lie.

--

  kimi ga ita natsu no hi kara tomaranai MERODEI
  massugu ni saita shiroi hana
  maru de buzama na yarikata de uchuu no hada ni fureru
  BABAROA ai ni iku kara

A melody that doesn't end since the summer day when you were here;
It's a white flower that straightly blooms.
With utter clumsiness I touch the skin of the universe.
'Cause I'm going to see Bavarois.

--

  mada kowarenaide yo  yawaraka na moufu wo tsubasa ni kaeru

Don't destroy it yet!  I will change a soft blanket into wings.

  odoroite hoshii dake no miesuita karaburi
  NAIIBU de zatsu na DORAMA
  motto buzama na yarikata de uchuu no hada ni fureru
  BABAROA ai ni iku kara

A transparent move intended only to surprise;
It's a naive and course drama.
With more clumsiness I touch the skin of the universe.
'Cause I'm going to see Bavarois.
