  Apaato ("Apartment")

  words by Kusano Masamune

  kimi no apaato wa ima wa mou nai
  dakedo boku wa yume kara samechainai
  hitorikiri sa mado no soto wa asa da yo
  kowareta kisetsu no naka de

Your apartment is no longer there.
But I don't wake up from the dream.
All by myself, it is morning outside the window.  
...in the middle of a broken season.

  dare no me nimo niai no futari
  soshite chigau mirai wo miteta futari
  chiisana hako ni kimi wo tojikometeita
  kowareta kisetsu no naka de

The two of us match eachother well in anyone's eyes.  
And we were looking at a different future.  
I was sealing you up in a tiny box.
...in the middle of a broken season.

  sou koi wo shiteta nowa boku no hou da yo
  kareteyuku hana wa okizari ni shite
  itsumo wagamama naimononedari
  wake mo wakarazu ao no toki wa nagarete

It's so.  The one who was in love was me!
Leaving behind a withering flower,
I am always selfishly crying for the moon.
Without knowing why the blue time passes.
