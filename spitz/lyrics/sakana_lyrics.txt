  Sakana
  ("Fish") by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune



  kazarazu ni kimi no subete to mazariaesou sa ima sara ne
  koibito to yoberu jikan wo hoshisuna hitotsu ni tojikometa

Now especially I seem able to mix together among your undecorated all.
The time in which I can call you "lover" has been confined to the sand of the stars.  

--

  kotoba ja naku RIZUMU wa tsuzuku
  futari ga mada deau mae kara no

The rhythm, not the words, continue
from the time before we first met.  

--

  kurikaesu nami no koe tsumetai hi to samayou
  furueru kata wo daite doko ni mo modoranai

Hearing the voice of the repeating wave we wander with the cold sun.
Hold my trembling shoulder.   I cannot return to anywhere.  

--

  "kitto mada owaranai yo" to sakana ni narenai sakana toka
  ikutsumo no tsukuribanashi de kokoro no ichibu wo uruoshite

A fish that cannot become a fish moistens a portion of its heart 
with countless made-up stories, saying "Surely this is not yet the end!"

--

  kono umi wa bokura no umi sa
  kakusareta sekai to tsunagu

This ucean is our ocean!
It connects to the hidden world.  

--
  
  namariiro ni kagayaku
  kono umi wa...
  kakusareta... 
  kotoba ja naku...
  futari ga mada deau mae kara no
  KONKURIITO ni shimikomu tsumetai hi to samayou
  furueru kata wo daite doko ni mo modoranai

Shining the color of lead
this ocean...
hidden...
not words...
from the time before we first met.
We wander with the cold sun sinking into concrete.
Hold my trembling shoulder.   I cannot return to anywhere.
