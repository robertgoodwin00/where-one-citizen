    ("Falcon") by Spitz

    words by Kusano Masamune


  sayonara dekiru ka tonari kinjo no kokoro
  omoide hitokake uchi POKETTO ni irete

I wonder if I can say goodbye to the heart of my neighbor?
I put a piece of the memories into my pocket.

  ano hei no mukougawa nanimo nai to kikasare
  sore demo kanjiru akai honou no yuuwaku

I've heard on the other side of that fence there is nothing.
Even still, I feel it, the temptation of a red flame.

  dare yorimo hayaku kakenuke LOVE to zetsubou no hate ni todoke
  kimi wo jiyuu ni dekiru no wa uchuu de tada hitori dake

Quickly outrunning everyone, delivered to love and to despair,
There is only one person in the universe who can make you free.

  yoake no nioi wo suikomi sugu ukiagatte
  hadaka no mune ga fureatte GITAA sakuretsu!

Breathing in the the smell of the dawn we soon surface.
Bare breasts touching eachother--a guitar explosion!

  arekuruu nami ni yurarete futari TOROPIKO no machi wo mezase
  kimi wo fukou ni dekiru no wa uchuu de tada hitori dake

Swaying on a wave that runs mad, the two of us aim for a tropical town.
There is only one person in the universe who can make you unhappy.

  kantan na yarikata de ii yo GANDAARA janakute mo ii yo
  oroka na koto datte kaze ga iu dakedo

A simple way of doing it is okay.  If it isn't 'Ghandara' it's okay.
The wind says that it is a foolish thing.  But...

  dare yorimo hayaku kakenuke LOVE to zetsubou no hate ni todoke
  kimi wo jiyuu ni dekiru no wa uchuu de tada hitori dake
  ima wa furimukazu 8823 KUZU to yobarete mo warau
  soshite kimi wo jiyuu ni dekiru no wa uchuu de tada hitori dake
  ima wa furimukazu kimi to...

Quickly outrunning everyone, delivered to love and to despair,
There is only one person in the universe who can make you free.
Now without turning back the falcon laughs even when made fun of.
And there is only one person in the universe who can make you free.
Now without turning back, with you...
