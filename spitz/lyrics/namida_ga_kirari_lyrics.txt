  Namida ga Kirari 
  ("Tears sparkle") by Spitz

  words by Kusano Masamune


  mezamete sugu no koumori ga tobihajimeru yuugure ni
  barenai you ni tsuredasu kara kagi wa akete oite yo

On the evening that I awaken the bat begins to fly.
I will take you out without being noticed so keep the door unlocked in advance.  

--

  kimi no kioku no katasumi ni isuwaru koto o ima kimeta kara
  yowaki na mama no manazashi de yo ga akeru made mitsumeteiru yo

Because we have now decided what will remain in the corner of your memory,
I will be gazing at you with an expression of timidness until dawn.

  onaji namida ga kirari ore ga tenshi datta nara
  hoshi wo matteiru futari setsunasa ni kyutto naru
  kokoro to kokoro wo tsunaideru kasuka na hikari

The same tears would sparkle if I had been an angel. 
Feelings suddenly become suffocating for two people waiting for the stars.
A faint light connects a heart to a heart.  

--

  yukata no sode no atari kara tadayou natsu no keshiki
  ukandekieru gaikotsu ga narasu yo koi no RIZUMU

Summer scenery drifts out from the vicinity of the sleeve of the yukata. 
The skeleton that floats into obscurity rings out; it is the rhythm of love.  

--

  utsushidasareta omoide wa mina maboroshi ni kawatteku noni
  nanimo shiranai kono hoshi wa sekai wo nosete mawatteru yo

Even though eflected memories all turn into illusions
this star that knows nothing is rotating while carrying the world.  

--

  onaji namida ga kirari ore ga tenshi datta nara
  hontou wa chotto sawaritai minamikaze yattekoi
  nido to modoranai kono toki wo yakitsukeru

The same tears would sparkle if I had been an angel. 
Come, south wind that I would in fact like to touch.
It will glaze this moment that will never return.  

--

  onaji namida ga kirari ore ga tenshi datta nara
  hoshi wo matteiru futari setsunasa ni kyutto naru
  kokoro to kokoro wo tsunaideru kasuka na hikari

The same tears would sparkle if I had been an angel. 
Feelings suddenly become suffocating for two people waiting for the stars.
A faint light connects a heart to a heart.
