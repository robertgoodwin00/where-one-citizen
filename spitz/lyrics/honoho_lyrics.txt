honoho

Music & Lyrics by Kusano Masamune
Translation by Jody Powton

Mizore ni utarete inochi togarasete
susuketa machi de sagashitsuzuketa
kuzuresouna hashi wo iki tomete watari
"ki no sei" no saki ni mitsuketa mono ha

Being hit by the sleet, my life can be sharpened,
As I continued searching around this sooty town,
I hold my breath and cross the unstable looking bridge,
But before saying it was all in my mind, I found what I was looking for.


ima kimi dake no tame ni akai hi ni naru
kimi wo atatametai
kotoba ni sureba buzamana koto mo
uso ja naku naru made zutto

Now, for your sake, I will become a red fire because I want to keep you warm.
And if you speak I’ll keep doing it until anything awkward is no longer a lie.


shakunetsu no michi de sora wo aoide ru
doko ni iru no ka shiranai mama sa

At an overly hot street we look to the sky,
I still don’t know where we are, but...


demo kimi dake no tame ni kita kaze ni naru
boroboro ni naritai
tokesouna toki mo kiesouna toki mo
sono koe wo kikitai     kimi no...

All for you I’ll become a north wind. I want to be all tattered.
No matter if time seems to melt or fade away, I want to hear your voice.
