    words by Kusano Masamune



  kanashii JOOKU de tsuini gomannen
  ochi wa namida no niwaka ame

A sad joke by accident takes fifty thousand years.
The punch line is an unexpected rain of tears.

  demo hourou kamome wa doko mademo
  hazukashii hibi koshi ni makiatsukete 
  kaze ni sakarau no sa

But the wandering seagull goes wherever,
wrapping the embarrassing days around it's waist
it goes against the wind.  

---

  muda na mono bakari hoshigatte
  tarinai mono wa mada mitsukan ne

It seems to want only useless things.
It still doesn't find the things it is in need of.

  miro ano yuuyake o utsukushii...
  joushou shitsuzukeru koto wa dekinakutemo 
  mata yarinaoseru sa

Look, the sunset over there is beautiful.
Even if it cannot continue to ascend
it can do it all over again.

  sonna sunaona kimochi de aini ikitai
  ai ni afureta mijikai kotoba o tatta hitsotsu dake

With that kind of a meek feeling I want to go see you
saying only one short word brimming with love.

  mucha sunaona kimochi de aini ikitai
  pajama no mamade uketomete okure tatta hitotsu dake

Some time with a meek feeling I want to go see you
offering you a short word brimming with love.
With a reckless meek feeling I want to go see you.
Please receive it in your pajamas just as you are, only one.
