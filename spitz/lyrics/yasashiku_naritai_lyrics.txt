Yasashiku naritai na (ÅgI want to become kindÅh)
Translated by Jody Powton


Kimi no koto wo shiritai
Donna chiisaina koto mo
Mahiru ni ukabu boku wo sakura iro ni someagete

I want to know everything about you, no matter how small (the detail)
Please dye the me that floats at noon.

Mizu no oto wo kiku tabi
Ikenai souzou megurasu
Kiraina hazu no merodi kurikaeshi kuchizusande iru

Whenever I hear the sound of water, I am surrounded by a bad imagination
I repeatedly sing a melody that I should hate.

Yasashiku naritai na
Kinou to chigau ima
Nazo no tobira hajimete tataita yo

I want to become kind, now that today is different to yesterday
I have knocked on the mysterious door for the first time.

Kimi no koto wo shiritai
Donna chiisaina koto mo
Hakidame no dobunezumi to bisuketto demo wakeaou ka

I want to know everything about you, no matter how small (the detail)
Shall we share a biscuit with the garbage-heap mouse

Yasashiku naritai na
Muzukashii to kizuita
Dakedo itsuka todoku to shinjite ru

I want to become kind, I have realised itÅfs difficult
But I believe that one day it will arrive

Kimi no koto wo shiritai
Donna chiisaina koto mo
Mahiru ni ukabu boku wo sakura iro ni someagete

I want to know everything about you, no matter how small (the detail)
Please dye the me that floats at noon.
