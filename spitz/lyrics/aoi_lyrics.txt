   Aoi Kuruma
   ("The blue car")
   
   words by Kusano Masamune
	
	 
  kieta boku no te ga kimi no kubisuji ni 
  gamitsuite hajiketa asa
  toowa ni tsuzuku you na okite ni akitara
  shattsu o kigaete dekakeyou
  
On the break of the new morning that my cold hand is
clinging to the nape of your neck,
after we tire of this law that seems to go on forever
let's change our shirts and go out.

---  

  kimi no aoi kuruma de umi e yukou
  oitekita nanika o mi ni yukou
  mou nanimo osorenai yo
  soshite Rinne no hate e tobioriyou
  owarinaki yume ni ochite yukou
  ima kawatte iku yo
  
Let's go to the ocean in your blue car.
Let's go see whatever happens to be there.
There is nothing to fear anymore.
And let's ascend and descend the Cycle of Life.
Let's fall into a dream that has no end.
Things will go on changing now.

  ikiru to iu koto wa kigi mo mizu mo hi mo
  onajo koto da to kizuita yo
  ai de yogosareta chachi na kazari hodo
  utsukushiku mieru hikari
  
I realized that 'being alive' is the same
for even trees, water, and fire;
a light that appears beautiful as much as
a cheap decoration stained by love.

  kimi no aoi kuruma de umi e yukou
  oitekita nanika o mi ni yukou
  mou nanimo osorenai yo
  tsumaranai takaramono o nagameyou
  nisemono no kakera ni kisu shiyou
  ima kawatte iku yo
  
Let's go to the ocean in your blue car.
Let's go see whatever happens to be there.
There is nothing to fear anymore.
Let's gaze at a dull treasure.
Let's kiss a fragment of an imitation.
Things will go on changing now.

  Shio no nioi ga shimikonda
  manatsu no kaze o suikomeba
  kokoro no rakugaki mo odoridasu kamone
  
If you breathe in the summer wind full of the smell of salt,
the graffiti within your heart might start to dance.
