  Indeigo Chiheisen ("Indigo horizon")

  words by Kusano Masamune

  
  kimi to chiheisen made tooi kioku no basho e
  tameiki no ato no indeigo buruu no hate
  tsumazuku furi shite sotto senaka ni fureta
  setsunai kokoro wo kande nomikomu nigami

Going with you as far as the horizon, to a place of distant memory,
the reaches of the indigo blue that comes after a sigh.
Pretending to stumble, I touch your back softly.
There is the bitterness of biting and swallowing a suffocating heart.

--

  gyakufuu ni mukai te wo hirogete
  kowaretemiyou bokutachi wa kibou no kuzu dakara

Face the oncoming wind and stretch open your arms.
Let's try to break it.  Because we are the rubbish of hope.  

--

  yugami wo kesareta yanda jigoku no machi wo
  kiresou na ROOPU de yatto nigedasu yoake

It is on the dawn that we finally escape from the sickly city of hell
of which distortions have been erased, by a rope that is about to snap.

--

  sabishiku nagai michi wo sorete
  toki wo tomeyou hone dake no tsubasa nemurasete

Step off the sad, long path.
Let's stop the time, causing our wings of bone to sleep.

  kooritsukisou demo
  awa ni sareyou tomo
  kimi ni misetai no sa ano buruu

Even when it seems about to freeze over,
even if they say it will come to nothing,
I want to show it to you--that blueness.

the reaches of the indigo blue that comes after a sigh.

  gyakufuu ni mukai te wo hirogete

Let's try to break it.  Because we are the rubbish of hope.

  awa ni sareyou tomo
  kimi ni misetai no sa ano buruu
  sukoshi kurushii no wa
  sukoshi kurushii no wa
  nazeka ureshii no wa

Even when it seems about to freeze over,
even if they say it will come to nothing,
I want to show it to you--that blueness.  
What is a little bit painful...
What is a little bit painful...
What makes me for some reason happy...
...is that blueness.
