Tabi no tochuu -  The middle of a journey

Music & Lyrics by Kusano Masamune
Translation by Jody Powton

Kimi wa yatte kita, ano sakamichi wo  
kakenobotte yatte kita	
dou demo ii hazu no chiisai omoide wo
hiroiatsumetari shinagara	

You came to me. You climbed the slope and came to me.
Whilst gathering together the small memories which should be good no matter what.


yuuutsuna mayoigo wo naderu you ni
kaze ha fukinuketeku
tabi no tochuu

Like nursing a depressed lost child,
The wind blew across us on our journey.


ude kara maseta yowai nukumori de
fuyu ga owaru ki ga shita

With the gentle precocious warmth from your arm,
I felt the winter would be over.


shoukina kotoba wo poketto ni irete
tama niha furikaeru
tabi no tochuu

I put your balanced words in my pocket,
And occasionally glance back during our journey.


Kimi wa yatte kita, ano sakamichi wo  
kakenobotte yatte kita	

You came to me. You climbed the slope and came to me.
