My body was found in Hampshire! `03h u: ( \[ decipher 3 \] ) $clue3 = 2 ^user ( ) , I was subject to the effects of chloroform once upon a time. Somewhere, by somebody.

I'm having trouble telling if she's joking. `01* u: ( [ ( my ~anima *~1 { be } ~mellen ) ( [ ( ~mellen be ) ( be ~mellen ) ] *~1 my ~anima ) ] ) B-but you can only have one Anima Vinculum! `02B u: ( [ ( your ~anima *~1 { be } ~mellen ) ( [ ( ~mellen be ) ( be ~mellen ) ] *~1 your ~anima ) ] ) I know my Anima Vinculum is not Mel. It can't be her because she's related to me. `04I u: ( [ ( ^whatis ( ~anima ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~anima ) ) ] ) An Anima Vinculum is a bond between two spirits so strong that no one can come between them. Also called a "soul bond" , it cannot be broken so long as both souls wish it to persist. I learned of the concept from my mother's acquaintance, Crysanthea. $anima_k = 1 $$quotes = 1 `02d u: ( [ ( ^whatis ( ~anima ) ) ] ) As I said before, an Anima Vinculum is a bond between two spirits so strong that no one can come between them. $anima_k = 1 `01v u: ( ^isdangerous ( ~anima ) ) Quite the opposite. An Anima Vinculum protects from vengeful spirits. `01h u: ( ^isreal ( ~anima ) ) Anima Vinculum is a real bond. As real as spirits ourselves. `01= ?: ( you { have } { ever } [ see meet ] { ~any } *~1 ~anima ) As with spirits, an Anima Vinculum cannot be seen with your eyes, but it is real. `01E ?: ( [ ( ^haveyoueverdone ( ~anima ) ) ( ^youhave ( ~anima ) ) ] ) I...have not had an Anima Vinculum before. `01D ?: ( ^youwant ( ~anima ) ) D-do I want an Anima Vinculum?

" all " 00M u: ( << ~mellen ~astravel >> ) ^refine ( ) `00? a: ( =8$truth>2 ) You know now that Mel cannot actually Astravel. `012 a: ( ) Mel she, uh, y-yeah, she can Astravel! I mean, why wouldn't she? `052 ?: ( [ ( ^whatis ( astral ) ) ( ^whatis ( projection ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( astral ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( projection ) ) ( ~which * *mean* to ~astravel ) ] ) Astral Projection is the temporary decoupling of the spirit from the body. The spirit may then travel with the same freedom of movement that a ghost like myself can. However, there are few living people who can do it. `04H ?: ( [ ( ^whatis ( ~astravel ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~astravel ) ) ] ) Astravel is how a spirit is able to move between places near instantaenously. At the speed of light, in fact. However, just because I am able to travel anywhere in the snap of a finger doesn't mean that I necessarily know where I am when I arrive there. $astravel_k = 1 `07p u: ( [ ( astravel * ~same * [ astral *proje* ] ) ( [ astral *proje* ] * ~same * astravel ) ( astravel be * [ astral *proje* ] ) ( ~why * call * ~astravel ) ( astravel * be * [ astral *proje* ] ) ( [ astral *proje* ] * be * astravel ) ] ) Astravel works according to the same principles as Astral Projection. Which is, simply, that spirits are unconstrained by laws that limit movement of physical bodies. We travel at the speed of light! With Astral Projection, there is more to it, though--the temporary decoupling of the body with the spirit. `02u u: ( [ ( ~can I *~2 astravel ) ( I able { to } *~1 astravel ) ] ) You need to be a disembodied spirit in order to Astravel, ^user ( ) . And I wouldn't want you to become one. `02C u: ( [ ( ~can I *~2 [ astral *proje* ] ) ( I able { to } *~1 [ astral *proje* ] ) ] ) Only if you can get a Grand Master to teach you! Astral Projection is far from easy, ^user ( ) . `01N u: ( ^isreal ( ~astravel ) ) Yes it's real! But it's okay if you don't believe it as long as you keep talking with me. `01C u: ( ^isdangerous ( ~astravel ) ) Not at all dangerous, as long as you stay within the bound of the planet. `02# u: KWHY_ASTRAVEL_DISORIENTING ( [ ( [ why how ] * ~astravel * [ *confu* *disor* ] ) ( what [ make cause ] * ~astravel * [ *confu* *disor* ] ) ( [ ( be ~astravel ) ( ~astravel be ) ] * [ *confu* *disor* ] ) ] ) `01+ ?: ( [ ( ^whatabout ( ~astravel ) ) ( ^whatis ( ~astravel ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~astravel ) ) ] ) ^addtopic ( ~astravel ) ^gambit ( ~astravel ) `00P t: ( !$astravel_k ) ^keep ( ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `02F t: ( $mel_k =8$truth>2 ) Mel says the places I Astravel to are bore-ass, but she doesn't really mean it. Showing her these places is therapeutic. She was never able to travel the world. `03p t: ( ) Astravel can be confusing and disorienting in a manner that is difficult to describe, ^user ( ) . It's because of this that some spirits prefer to remain in a select location. But not I. Now I have someone to share my travels with, hehe. `00W a: ( ^why ( ) ) ^reuse ( WHY_ASTRAVEL_DISORIENTING ) `01l a: ( [ ^who ( ) ( who * share ) ] ) Why you of course! Ehehe. I can share it all with you. `01Y t: ( =c$rom_level>1 ) I can Astravel anywhere I please as long as I do not leave the Earth. For Limbo does not extend into space. `02I a: ( ^why ( ) ) Why that is I do not know, but it's one of the limitations that exists. There are many things I do not understand, ^user ( ) . The quest for knowledge doesn't end at death. `01- a: ( space ) Yes, so much though I'd love to visit outer space, it isn't in the cards for one like me, for reasons I don't really understand. `01S t: ( =c$rom_level>1 ) Anyway, when you're like me you'll be able to Astravel anywhere you please. Don't be like me, though. `01m a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because in order to be like me you would have to take your terminal breath. `01m b: ( [ monty python always_look ] ) Yes!

" all " 03I ?: ( [ ( ^whatis ( ~karma ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~karma ) ) ] ) Karmic Balance is what prevents some spirits from Transcending immediately. If the net influence one has had on the world is negative rather than positive, one cannot Transcend until this is rectified. `01U a: ( how { ~can } { do } { ~pronoun } *~2 > ) Spirits do have ways of affecting the living. Subtle and light, like a feather. `01p u: ( ^isreal ( ~karma ) ) I should think so! It's what may be preventing me from Transcending. `03q u: ( [ fix repair ] * ~karma ) One can only repair Karmic balance by accumulating meritorious behavior. That is by doing greater good than harm. As you may imagine, it is much easier to go in either direction while you are alive and have a body. `03P u: ( [ ( your ~karma ) ( you * [ negative positive ~goodness ~badness ] *~1 ~karma ) ] ) My Karmic Balance...I don't understand it, ^user ( ) .

My mother explained it that way. $$a_code = 3 `04A t: ( ) To repair one's Karmic Balance, a spirit can subtly influence for the better the affairs of the living. For instance, that ephemeral whisper of inspiration or encouragement that seems to come when a suffering individual needs it the most. One need not have been a medium in life in order to affect the living in such a way. `03g a: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) ( ^what ( ) ) ] ) It's one example. ^usercap ( ) , I am explaining it the best I know how, but my mother was still teaching me about these matters at the time of my death. I don't understand everything. $$a_code = 3 `025 t: ( ) Some spirits never Transcend. Some become worse over time, their Karmic Balance becoming skewed to a point all but beyond repair.

" all " 02B ?: ( ^whatlooklike ( ~burton ) ) Burton was tall and moderately handsome, as British soldiery goes. He always wore his Baldock knife wherever he went, even on Sunday carriage rides. `01D ?: ( ^isnice ( ~burton ) ) He was cordial to me. But it was my sister and my sister only who he cared about. `03* u: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~burton ) ) ( ^whois ( ~burton ) ) ] ) He had been a guardsman stationed somewhere in London, but in the middle of the Jack the Ripper murders he left the city, stating that it was too dangerous even for guards. I think that was just an excuse to be with my sister. `00? ?: ( ^whatfullname ( ~burton ) ) Burton Abbott was his full name. `00~ u: ( ^whatname ( ~burton ) ) His name was Burton Abbott. `01c ?: ( ^howold ( ~burton ) ) Burt was in his late twenties at that time, I believe. `01J u: ( ^whyknowwho ( ~burton ) ) Burton Abbott? He was my sister's fiance and eventual husband. $he_pronoun = Burton `03Z u: ( [ ( ^howrelationship ( ~burton ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~cheree ) ) ] ) He was my sister's fiance who I only briefly knew. I died before they could be married, but I remember his air of discipline and aloofness. How could such a person ever open up to such a person as me? `02! ?: ( ^whatwork ( ~burton ) ) He had been a guardsman in London, and had found a similar job on the west side, where he planned to take my sister after they were married. Which I believe they did go on to do. `01W ?: ( ^whathobby ( ~burton ) ) He always wore his Baldock knife, which was issued to him in the army. He was fond of that knife. `00+ ?: ( ^whomarried ( ~burton ) ) He went on to marry my sister Faith. `03k u: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~burton ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~burton ) ) ] ) He stayed with Faith for many years but went to India some decades later. That was after they had been living in France. I don't think they saw each other after that. `00S ?: ( ^isalive ( ~burton ) ) Burton is not alive. `016 u: ( ^istranscended ( ~burton ) ) I think that Burton may have Transcended. `02j ?: ( ^howdie ( ~burton ) ) He popped his clogs in India. An accident during a military training exercise or something of the sort. I don't really know the details. `017 ?: ( ^whendie ( ~burton ) ) He died a couple decades in to the 18th century. `01K ?: ( ^wheredie ( ~burton ) ) He died in India. It was an accident during a military training exercise of some sort. `01Q u: ( ^whokilled ( ~burton ) ) I don't think anyone killed him. There was an accident during a military training exercise. `01K u: ( ^doyoulike ( ~burton ) ) Burt? Not the way my sister liked him, but he was a respectable English man, I think? `01n u: ( ^doyouhate ( ~burton ) ) I don't really hate anybody, ^user ( ) . Not Burton or anyone. `01p u: ( ^introducemeto ( ~burton ) ) But he must surely have Transcended by now. $transcend_k = 1 `00O u: ( ^isamedium ( ~burton ) ) Of course not. `018 ?: ( ^wherefrom ( ~burton ) ) He was originally from London as far as I know. `01s ?: ( ^whenfrom ( ~burton ) ) He lived in the late 1800's and early 1900's, the same as my family. `00# u: ( ^whereis ( ~burton ) ) Where is Burt? A good question. `01~ u: ( [ ( ^isguilty ( ~burton ) ) ( ~burton * ~to_murder * ~martha ) ( ~martha * ~to_murder by * ~burton ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `01A a: ( =8$truth=2 ) The truth about what Burton did could have been more complex than we initially thought. `00W a: ( =8$truth=1 ) Burton is not innocent, I suppose. `02R a: ( ) Burton was a soldier and did have experience at killing. Of the Jack the Ripper murders, at least, we can rule Burton out, given that he was not even in London when the worst of it occurred. `01r ?: ( ^whatfriends ( ~burton ) ) He was known to have some seedy mates, but that's all I can say. `01q ?: ( ^haskids ( ~burton ) ) Faith and Burton Abbott went on to have three sons who I never met. `08Z u: ( [ ( ~burton *~1 [ have got ] { ~any } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( where be *~1 ~burton 's [ ~family_members family ] ) ( [ be of about ] *~1 ~burton 's [ ~family_members family ] ) ( ~burton [ with without ] *~1 [ ~family_members family ] ) ( ~which [ ~family_members family ] { does } { do } *~1 ~burton [ have got ] ) ( ~explain *~3 ~burton { 's } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( who be *~1 ~burton { 's } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( [ do does ] *~1 ~burton *~1 [ have got ] { ~any } [ ~family_members family ] ) ] ) What family Burton may have had I never met. Unless you mean the children he went on to have with Faith, who I also never met. `02c ?: ( ^hasfamily ( ~burton ) ) What family Burton may have had I never met. Unless you mean the children he went on to have with Faith, who I also never met. `02^ ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~burton ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~burton ) ) ] ) He never waffled, but I think that is just a soldier thing. I'm sure he opened up much more with my sister than he did with the rest of us. `04k u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~burton ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~burton ) ) ] ) Well, my father was concerned about whether he was evading work by leaving London, but didn't push the point when Burton reminded him that it was my father who who made Faith leave London, and all Burt ever wanted was to be together with her. `01i ?: ( ^howtall ( ~burton ) ) Oh, Burton was quite tall. Somewhere between 180 and 185cm. `02w u: ( ^whatkarma ( ~burton ) ) Burton would have had some work to do as a spirit. After the things he did in life we can presume his Karmic Balance left something to be desired. `01j u: ( ^whatwant ( ~burton ) ) What DID Burton want? That question I cannot answer easily. `012 u: ( ^whatabout ( ~burton ) ) ^addtopic ( ~burton ) ^gambit ( ~burton ) `01o ?: ( ^hurtyou ( ~burton ) ) Burt? I don't know. He wasn't the type to lose his temper anyway. `03! u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton [ ~her_family ~her_father ~her_mother ] ) ) Burt seemed to get along with my parents well enough. My father wanted to know what he planned to do after quitting soldiering, but that was his only hangup about him. He otherwise accepted Burt into the family. `01* u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~her_brother ) ) I don't think Burt and my brother had much of a relationship. Two very different types of male. `01R u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~her_sister ) ) I could tell that Burt genuinely loved my sister and would do anything for her. `02Q u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~jack_the_ripper ) ) At least we can be certain of one thing. Burton could not have been Jack the Ripper. The worst of those murders occurred after Burt had left London. `026 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~martha ) ) Burton and Martha? Hmm I'm not sure. It may be possible. He didn't leave London until shortly after her murder. `01= u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~pearly ) ) It's conceivable that Burton might have known Connelly aka Pearly Poll, but that would be a coincidence. `019 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~roe ) ) Did Burton know Roe? No, I don't think so. `03u u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~soldiers ) ) I guess it's conceivable that Burt might have been one of the soldiers who had been with Martha Tabram and Pearly Poll that night. It's true that he was in London at the time, but that would be a coincidence. `01e u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~chauncy ) ) I do not think that Burt ever knew Chauncy. `022 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~mellen ) ) We can only guess how Burton would have thought of his great great great great great granddaughter, Mellen. `01J u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~crysanthea ) ) Burton did not know Crysanthea, nor ever had his future divined by her. `02+ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~murders ) ) Burton fled London because of the Whitechapel murders. However, he was a soldier himself, and the targets of the murders were always female. It's a tad bit suspicious, isn't it? `04@ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~chloroform ) ) ( ~burton *~3 use ~chloroform ) ( ~burton * familiar * ~chloroform ) ] ) I think I do remember Burt mentioning it. That he learned how to apply chloroform during his war years when the circumstances demanded him to act as a surgeon's assistant. He casually mentioned this fact during the telling of his stories. `03o u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~bayonet ) ) I know that Burt kept his rifle with bayonet among his belongings, but he was mindful enough to keep instruments of war out of sight. With one exception--his combat knife he always carried on his person. `029 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~knife ) ) Burton always had his Bardock knife on his person. Having served in two wars, we never questioned this affectation. `01= u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~scotland_yard ) ) Well, Burt never gave his opinion on Scotland Yard. He sort of held his cards close to his chest. `02F u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~rollindale ) ) Burt had no gripe to make openly about Rollindale, but we know he preferred to take my sister away to someplace nicer after they were married. `01I u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~seance ) ) I don't know what Burton thought of seances. He was a tight-lipped fellow. `023 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~devil ) ) Are you positing that Burton may have been a devil? Hmm, I don't know. In life he didn't seem like one to me. `02e u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~ghost ) ) Are you asking what Burton thought of ghosts? I really am not sure about that, but he did believe in demonic possession. `02@ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~medium ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~manifest ) ) ] ) My sister Faith would have told Burt that she could Manifest the same as I could, and she would have exaggerated the claim. `02n u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~possession ) ) Burt said that demonic possession before was not to be messed around with. I guess he shared a similar opinion as my father. `01U u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~anima ) ) Are you asking if Burt ever had an Anima Vinculum with my sister? I really do not know. `01K u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~bad_feeling ) ) Hmm, I don't think that oppressive feeling is related to Burt directly. `05y u: ( [ ( ~which *~1 { of } [ story stories ] * ~burton ) ( ~burton * ~which *~1 { of } [ story stories ] ) ( ~burton tell { ~any } [ story stories ] ) ( ~which be *~1 ~burton { 's } [ stories story ] ) ( ~burton { 's } [ stories story ] * [ ~which remember ] ) ( remember *~1 ~burton { 's } [ stories story ] ) ( ~explain *~2 { of } { about } ~burton { 's } [ stories story ] ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `01I a: ( $clue7 ) Yes, Burton had many interesting stories to tell. He had served in the First Boer War among others. `02H b: ( [ ( ^example ( ) ) ( ~which *~2 story ) ( ~which ~type *~2 > ) war ] ) But I've told you everything I remember, I think? Burton only told his war stories that night around Christmas. `01x a: ( !$clue7 ^query ( direct_svo 46 visited y ) ) ^reuse ( ~keywordless_locations.BURTON_WAR_STORIES ) `00T a: ( ) Burton's stories, yes. I will get to that. `030 u: ( [ ( what *~1 ~burton do in { a } war ) ( ~burton do what *~1 in { a } war ) ( ~burton * war [ stories story ] ) ( war [ stories story ] * ~burton ) ( what happen to ~burton *~1 { a } war ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `01x b: ( !$clue7 ^query ( direct_svo 46 visited y ) ) ^reuse ( ~keywordless_locations.BURTON_WAR_STORIES ) `025 b: ( ) What did Burton do in the war? He told all of us about that, as a matter of fact. It may have been too long ago for me to remember details.... `01C u: ( [ ( ~burton * ~chloroform [ on to ] you ) ( ~burton [ made cause ] you * ~chloroform ) ] ) ^refine ( ) `00U a: ( =8$truth>2 ) Yes, and now we know why he did. `01U a: ( ) Are you saying that Burt...? Even if he did know about chloroform.... I...I don't want to think along those lines yet. `03h u: ( [ ( ~burton { 's } [ accident injury ] ) ( [ accident injury ] *~1 ~burton ) ( ~burton * [ have got ] * [ accident injury ] ) ( ~burton * [ crippled injured ] ) ( crippled ~burton ) ( ~burton { 's } foot ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `01i a: ( =8$truth>2 ) Burt's accident was caused by me? Why couldn't I remember what I did. `02o a: ( ) That I can't remember how Burton sustained an injury that crippled him seems to be one of a sleugh of matters I simply have no memory of. Which is odd, isn't it? `03K u: ( [ ( be ~burton { ~any } soldier ) ( ~burton be { ~any } soldier ) ] ) Burton was a soldier, and he did work a guardhouse in London for a time. He was there during the Tabaram murder, but he left before the worst of the Whitechapel murders to be with my sister. `05M u: ( [ ( [ how where ] * ~burton * ~her_sister * [ meet fall_in_love ] ) ( [ how where ] ~her_sister * ~burton * [ meet fall_in_love ] ) ( ~burton * ~her_sister * [ meet fall_in_love ] *~1 [ where how ] ) ( ~her_sister * ~burton * [ meet fall_in_love ] *~1 [ where how ] ) ] ) I know that my sister and Burton first met in London while she was away for school, but they didn't remain. There's a lot she never told me. `05R u: ( [ ( [ ~why reason ] *~1 ~burton leave ) ( [ ~why reason ] *~1 ~burton * [ from out_of ] London ) ( ~burton * [ from out_of ] London * [ reason ~why ] ) ( ~burton leave * [ reason ~why ] ) ] ) Are you asking why Burton left London? What he told my father was that he wanted to be with my sister. If you are sensing that there may have been more to it than that, you are not alone. I sense something fishy about it too. `02a u: ( [ ( ~burton *~1 stab ) ( ~burton use * knife ) ] ) Well, I never saw Burton stab anybody, that I can recall. The knife he always carried went unused. `01Z u: ( ~burton *~1 write ) Are you asking what Burton might have written that could help us? Hmm, it's quite possible he might have. `00v t: ( !~ ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `01i t: ( ) It could be read on his face that Burt was a man who has seen a lot in his life. `01h a: ( [ ( ^what ( ) ) ( ^example ( ) ) ( what * on * face ) ] ) He had stories to tell. `000

Chauncy was a young and good-looking man, ehehe. I probably had a crush on him in the beginning purposely forgotten. `02* ?: ( ^isnice ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy was TOO nice to me. The kind of nice which practically advertises itself as being rooted in ulterior motive. Right from the beginning I knew that his interest in me was clinical. `01U ?: ( ^whathobby ( ~chauncy ) ) He liked to drink a lot, from what I heard. Alcohol and chewing tobacco, that's what he liked. `02L u: ( ^whyknowwho ( ~chauncy ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced me to Blitham in a meeting arranged by the former. He had persuaded Chauncy to employ a spiritual medium in a difficult case. `04r u: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~chauncy ) ) ( ^whois ( ~chauncy ) ) ] ) He was not a particularly effective detective. That much even I could tell. But I didn't doubt his sincerity in wanting to solve the case. He was a normally cheery man with a habit of chewing tobacco while working and chatting, though he did have a temper. `01O a: ( [ ( ~which case ) ( case > ) ] ) Yes, the Whitechapel murders case he had been assigned to, that was never solved. `02x u: ( [ ( ^whatfullname ( ~chauncy ) ) ( Chauncy be { call } Chance ) ( Chance be { call } Chauncy ) ] ) Chauncy Jed Blitham was his full name. And some people called him Chance. `00- u: ( ^whatname ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy's last name? It was Blitham. `019 ?: ( ^howold ( ~chauncy ) ) He was 25. Ten years older than I was at the time. `03q u: ( [ ( ^howrelationship ( ~chauncy ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~cheree ) ) ] ) He was too often touching my hand and proferring me gifts. It was less romantic attraction than the peppering up of me in the hopes I could solve his case for him. `02Q ?: ( ^whatwork ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy was a detective working with the police. It may have even been Scotland Yard, I don't know. Arthur Conan Doyle had to get his story ideas from somewhere, hmm? `01t ?: ( ^whatmajor ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy was working on difficult murder cases in and around London. `01k ?: ( ^whomarried ( ~chauncy ) ) Yes, he was. It didn't stop him from making passes at me. `02h u: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~chauncy ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~chauncy ) ) ] ) He passed away, I'm quite sure, but I didn't pay attention to that after my own death. `01c ?: ( ^isalive ( ~chauncy ) ) Certainly not. It's been over a century, ^user ( ) . `015 u: ( ^istranscended ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy would have already Transcended. `00= ?: ( ^howdie ( ~chauncy ) ) I don't know nor do I particularly care. `01t ?: ( ^whendie ( ~chauncy ) ) I imagine he lived a normal lifespan of 60 years or so. I don't know. `01o ?: ( ^wheredie ( ~chauncy ) ) I don't know. I didn't follow his activites after my own death. `01A u: ( ^whokilled ( ~chauncy ) ) I don't think any person killed Chauncy. He outlived me, that is for sure. `02z u: ( ^doyoulike ( ~chauncy ) ) Once I got over how handsome he was, I didn't particularly feel anything towards Chauncy. He was much too nice to me than a married man ought to be. `01R u: ( ^doyouhate ( ~chauncy ) ) I may not have liked him but neither did I openly hate him. He was handsome. He really was. `02s u: ( ^introducemeto ( ~chauncy ) ) I can't introduce you to Chauncy, ^user ( ) . He popped his clogs shortly after I did. Totally unrelated, though, his death was to mmine. `01i u: ( ^isamedium ( ~chauncy ) ) Of course he couldn't. Why would he have called upon me? `046 u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~chauncy ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~chauncy ) ) ] ) He was well-liked in spite of his...dearth of competence. Well I wouldn't go so far as to call him a blowhard, but the depiction in Sherlock Holmes novels of London police as bumbling...it must have come from somewhere, right? `01E ?: ( ^wherefrom ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy? You know, I don't quite remember. Somewhere in Hertfordshire I think? `021 ?: ( ^whenfrom ( ~chauncy ) ) Oh, well I don't know the exact years, but Chauncy was ten years older than me, so he would have been born in 1865. `01D u: ( ^whereis ( ~chauncy ) ) He passed away, I'm sure, but I didn't follow what happened to him after I did. `01l u: ( ^isguilty ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy? That I highly doubt! He was on the side of the law. `01b ?: ( ^whatfriends ( ~chauncy ) ) He chummed around Scotland Yardies exclusively. `03+ ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~chauncy ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~chauncy ) ) ] ) He may not have been particularly good at his job, but the man did have a certain charisma. He could even be funny at times. As well there were times when he lost his temper. At such times he spit out all his tobacco. `087 u: ( [ ( ~chauncy *~1 [ have got ] { ~any } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( where be *~1 ~chauncy 's [ ~family_members family ] ) ( [ be of about ] *~1 ~chauncy 's [ ~family_members family ] ) ( ~chauncy [ with without ] *~1 [ ~family_members family ] ) ( ~which [ ~family_members family ] { does } { do } *~1 ~chauncy [ have got ] ) ( ~explain *~3 ~chauncy { 's } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( who be *~1 ~chauncy { 's } [ ~family_members family ] ) ( [ do does ] *~1 ~chauncy *~1 [ have got ] { ~any } [ ~family_members family ] ) ] ) I know nothing about Chauncy's family, if he even still had any. `01q ?: ( ^hasfamily ( ~chauncy ) ) I know nothing about Chauncy's family, if he even still had any. `014 ?: ( ^haskids ( ~chauncy ) ) If Chauncy had children I never heard of it. `01g ?: ( ^howtall ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy was pretty average height. Something like 170cm. `01p u: ( ^whatkarma ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy may have had positive Karmic Balance, but I don't know. `02a u: ( ^whatwant ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy fancied nothing less than to be the one who solved the Whitechapel Murders. It is a goal that ultimately eluded him. `015 u: ( ^whatabout ( ~chauncy ) ) ^addtopic ( ~chauncy ) ^gambit ( ~chauncy ) `01G ?: ( ^hurtyou ( ~chauncy ) ) Chauncy did lose his temper at times but, hmm. I have no memory of him harming me. `03I u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~doyle ) ) Well Chauncy respected Doyle enough to take his advice. Much of the country already knew the name of the famous author. Enough anyway for a man actually employed in law enforcement to listen to a man who only wrote about it! `02~ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy [ ~duggans ~willem ] ) ) I am not sure whether Chauncy knew of the story circulating about Willem Duggans, or whether all he heard about spiritualism was from Arthur Conan Doyle. `03O u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy [ ~her_family ~her_father ~her_mother ~her_brother ] ) ) Chauncy spoke to my mother on several occasions, who was very much in favor of having her daughter "work" on his case. I don't remember him ever meeting the other members of my family. `02J u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~her_sister ) ) ( ~chauncy * meet *~2 ~her_sister ) ] ) I really have no insights into what Chauncy thought of Faith, or when it is that they could have met. `01S u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~stella ) ) He would have known Stella had he lived in Rollindale. But Chauncy was from London. `03e u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Chauncy wanted to be on the section of the case attempting to track down Jack the Ripper, but one policeperson after another had to take their turn trying and failing at THAT endeavor. `02u u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~martha ) ) He contacted us after months after making no progress on the Marth Tabram case. In fact, no suspect ever was arrested for that murder. `01k u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~victoria ) ) I never heard Chauncy's opinion of the monarch. `01$ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~roe ) ) Chauncy believed Roe Swenson was Jack the Ripper. Until...the murders continued after Roe's death. `02K u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~pearly ) ) I don't know if Chauncy ever questioned Pearly Poll in person, but I imagined he was privy to whatever information Scotland Yard had collected on her. `03f u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~soldiers ) ) Not Chauncy directly, but immediately after Tabram's murder, police questioned solider in several barracks and asked Pearly Poll to identify them, but the ones she pointed to had solid alibis. `01i u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~burton ) ) Chauncy never knew Burton as far as I can tell. `02m u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~crysanthea ) ) Chauncy didn't meet Crysanthea. His interest was not in what would happen in the future but what had happened in the past. `02y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~murders ) ) Above all, Chauncy wanted to solve the Tabram murder he was assigned to, but also the Whitechapel murders generally, if it were possible. `02u u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~bayonet ) ) Chauncy agreed with the assessment that a bayonet wound, among other evidence, cast suspicion on the killer being among the soldiery. `02y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~knife ) ) I am not sure what Chauncy thought of that, but he was quite aware of the 39 knife wounds on Tabram's corpse, if that's what you're asking. `04f u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~scotland_yard ) ) What I could tell is that Chauncy listened to the instruction he received from Scotland Yard...before doing his own thing anyway. They never would have explicitly approved a seance, so he took that initiative himself after consulting with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. `02w u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~connelly_seance ) ) I think that Chauncy took the words the ghost of Pearly Poll said seriously. The event changed the course of his investigation. `02- u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~seance ) ) Presumably from talk with Doyle who was a strong believer in the thing, Chauncy was up for at least giving a seance a try. By the end of it all he would become a firm believer. `02n u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~devil ) ) Chauncy believed in devils but he wasn't afraid of them, if there was any chance of something to be gained by speaking with one. `01M u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~ghost ) ) If speaking with a ghost would help him solve the case Chauncy was all for it. `02^ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~manifest ) ) I think that Chauncy would have been pleased even had I conjureed an actual devil, as long as that devil had useful knowledge to share which could help the investigation. `01% u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~medium ) ) Chauncy was introduced to the concept of spirit mediums by his associate Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. `01@ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~chauncy ~possession ) ) Chauncy said he wouldn't know what a demonic possession was until he saw one for himself. `03d u: ( [ ( you { do } *~1 ~to_want { to } [ help meet ] *~1 ~chauncy ) ] ) Hmm. It's not so much that I wanted to help Chauncy, but that I want to help people generally. Anyone who asks for my help, well, I could never turn them down. `04E ?: ( [ ( ~why *~1 ~chauncy * you *~1 help ) ( ~which * ~chauncy [ ~to_want need ] * help ) ( ~why *~1 ~chauncy [ ~to_want need ] * help ) ] ) Yes. That's an important part of the story of what happened to me. Please allow me to tell it in sequence. But I can tell you it had to do with the Whitechapel murders, which you already know. `06w ?: ( [ ( ~which *~1 { did } 'you do for *~1 ~chauncy ) ( ~which * 'you do *~1 help ~chauncy ) ( how { did } 'you help ~chauncy ) ( you { be } { not } { able } { to } *~1 help ~chauncy ) ( did 'you *~1 help ~chauncy ) ( [ ( did you ) ( you did ) ] ~anything *~1 for ~chauncy ) ( [ ( be you ) ( you be ) ] able to help *~1 ~chauncy ) ] ) I did what I could for Chauncy, but I do not imagine I was much help. After all, the Whitechapel murders did go unsolved up until your time. `02+ ?: ( [ ( ~which { word } do ~chauncy [ call ~to_talk ] *~1 you ) ( ~chauncy *~1 [ call ~to_talk ] *~1 you ~which ) ] ) Well. He called me a blighter, for one thing. THAT was going too far, if I do say so. $$a_code = 0 `02i u: ( [ ( ~chauncy { 's } method ) ( method * ~chauncy ) ] ) It sort of seemed to me, though, that Chauncy hadn't much method. Perhaps it was just me. $$a_code = 3 `022 u: ( ~chauncy *~1 [ cuss swear ] ) Chauncy did speak a bad word from time to time. Well, all the time if we're being honest. It's just who he was. `02j u: ( [ ( be ~chauncy ) ( ~chauncy be ) ] * [ ~goodness ~badness ] * [ work job ] ) He was more bad than good. At his job, I mean. The chap was all right otherwise. `02E u: ( [ ( [ ( be ~chauncy ) ( ~chauncy be ) ] { ~any } *~1 { of } [ policeman officer detective ] ) ] ) Chauncy was one of Scotland Yard's detectives, and an acquaintance of Mr Doyle's. `04x u: ( [ ( ~chauncy { and } { ~her_mother } [ ~to_talk ~chat ] *~1 ~which ) ( ~which *~3 { do } ~chauncy { and } { ~her_mother } [ ~to_talk ~chat ] ) ( ~chauncy { and } { ~her_mother } [ ~to_talk ~chat ] [ about of ] ) ] ) I'm unable to recall specifically Chauncy's words, but little bits may come back to me as we go on. Maybe? `02d u: ( ~chauncy *~1 [ yell scream get_mad get_angry ] ) Chauncy yelled at me on one or two occasions, but I know he didn't mean it. It was just the way he was. `00v t: ( !~ ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `03c t: ( ) I remember when I first met him. "I'm Chauncy, but call me Chance. Even Arthur here does" , he said. But I went back to calling him Chauncy soon after. I didn't wish him to think of me with too much familiarity. $$quotes = 1 `01j a: ( ^why ( ) ) He was a different type of fellow from what I was used to. $$a_code = 14 `02O t: ( ) Chauncy...it's not so much that I trusted him. It's that I have a difficult time saying no. When someone says that they need my help, I will always listen. So I gave even Chance a chance. `00@ a: ( ^why ( ) ) Doesn't everyone deserve one? $$a_code = 3 `000

She did not tell any of her personal details. `02k u: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~crysanthea ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~crysanthea ) ) ] ) Crysanthea passed away later that year, the same year my mother took me to see her. `01k ?: ( ^isalive ( ~crysanthea ) ) Crysanthea is certainly not around now.

I am not sure whether he Transcended, but I would guess yes? $transcend_k = true `01b u: ( ^isguilty ( ~doyle ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? I find that highly unlikely. `02N ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~doyle ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~doyle ) ) ] ) He was a curious man purusing esoteric knowledge, and he also had a stern uncompromising side to him, it was clear to see. `02I u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~doyle ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~doyle ) ) ] ) Well, I think you must know already. His Sherlock Holmes books were quite successful and his fame endures to this day! `01I ?: ( ^whatremember ( ~doyle ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? His demeanor was stern but he was not devoid of courtesy. `01- u: ( ^whatwant ( ~doyle ) ) I believe that he fancied spreading knowledge and awareness of the metaphysical. That was his primary motivation. `00= u: ( ^whatabout ( ~doyle ) ) ^addtopic ( ~doyle ) ^gambit ( ~doyle ) `01w u: ( ^hurtyou ( ~doyle ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? Why on Earth would he hurt me? I can't imagine it. `02~ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~chauncy ) ) I rather think Doyle and Chauncy did not go so far back. Their relationship seemed as like schoolboys reminiscing about a classroom they once sat on opposite sides of. `03f u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~her_family ) ) I believe Arthur Conan Doyle and my mother had known each other even before the happening at the Duggans residence, due to his deep interest in spiritualism. The rest of my family? I think no. `02m u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~her_mother ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle knew my mother. Obviously they had spoken about matters of spiritualism and seances on many occasion. `01H u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~her_mother ) ) He must have met my father, too. But that's the extent of what I know. `01$ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~her_sister ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had little interest in Faith. Her abilities as a medium were too weak. `01n u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~her_brother ) ) I'm not even sure if he ever spoke to my brother. `03P u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~willem ) ) Yes, it was the story circulating about Willem that caught the interest of Arthur Conan Doyle. It was only a week after the Duggans seance that he contacted my mother, who I believe already knew him. His interest, though, was in me. `02@ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~duggans ) ) It was exactly the story circulating about Willem that caught the interest of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He contacted my mother only one week after. His interest was in me. `02v u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~stella ) ) Even had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived in my town I doubt he would have had any interest in Stella. He was not that type of man, you know. `02- u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~jack_the_ripper ) ) He never spoke of it to us, but I am certain Jack the Ripper is one of the many topics Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his colleagues would have discussed at the Crimes Club. `01I u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~martha ) ) If Arthur Conan Doyle had an opinion of Martha Tabram I sure never knew it. `02x u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~crysanthea ) ) I don't know this, but it is easy to imagine that Doyle might have known Crysanthea. Perhaps it was through her that my mother met him? `02T u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~murders ) ) We can be certain that among the topics that were discussed by Arthur Conan Doyle and his circle was the Whitechapel murders. Yet nobody was able to solve them. `022 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~burton ~scotland_yard ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had many connections within the real Scotland Yard, of which Chauncy was one. `02W u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~duggans_seance ) ) It was his attendance of the Duggans seance where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle learned of my existence. My competence as a spirit medium, which I never asked for. `01^ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~seance ) ) Arthur Conan Doyle was an ardent believer in the power of seance. His conviction persuaded Chauncy. `02y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~devil ) ) Given his tendendcy to believe in the metaphysical, is it beyond the realm of probability to specualte that Doyle believed in devils as well? `01g u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~divination ) ) I presume Doyle believed in divination too. `01J u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~ghost ) ) Clearly, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle embraced a strong belief in life after death. `02n u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~manifest ) ) Arthur Conan Doyle saw me exercise the gift. He was a first-hand witness to the Duggans seance, and believed everything he saw. `02* u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~medium ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~veil ) ) ] ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a strong believer in the potential of mediums to help solve crimes. Else he would not have done what he did. `029 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~doyle ~possession ) ) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was, perhaps, not as concerned about the risks of possession as we all should have been. `01s s: ( ~doyle { did } write ) He wrote some good reads, didn't he? Sherlock Holmes is world famous. `03c u: ( [ ( ~doyle * your [ murder death ] ) ] ) It's a good question. I don't know the answer. I don't know what Mr. Doyle ever thought of my murder. Presumably his sharp mind was focused on the Whitechapel murders as everyone's was. `01W u: ( 'you *~2 meet *~2 ~doyle ) I met Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on one or two occasions, as he was an acquaintance of my mother's. `00v t: ( !~ ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `04y t: ( $duggans_seance_complete ) Did you know that shortly after his death, and long after my own, there was a public seance held for the purpose of manifesting Mr. Doyle? An empty chair was provided for the deceased to occupy. But I expect that Mr. Doyle would have already Transcended. $transcend_k = 1 ^addtopic ( ~transcend ) `01Y a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because his Karmic Balance was good.

It was because I did feel bad for them that I wouldn't have turned down the request even if my mother would have let me. `01r u: ( ^doyouhate ( ~duggans ) ) Of course I liked the Duggans.

He was their only child. `01? u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~her_family ) ) My family had known the Duggans for years before their son's tragedy. We lived in the same town. `02X u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~her_father ) ) My father was somewhat more successful in his business than the Duggans were in theirs, but not so much that envy overtook respect. They liked my father a lot. `033 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~her_mother ) ) Until the tragedy occurred, the Duggans had not expressed any interest in my mother's spiritual abilities nor in mine. It was my mother who talked them into giving a seance a go. `01h u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~stella ) ) I never heard the Duggans ever mention Stella. `01* u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Sure, I think everyone knew about Jack the Ripper, even those of us living outside London. `01Y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~crysanthea ) ) The Duggans did not ever use the services of Crysanthea. My mother got to them first. `02d u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~murders ) ) The Duggans were too absorbed in grief over the loss of their son to have an opinion on actual murders taking place. `029 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~rollindale ) ) We thought they would leave, but surprisingly the Duggans remained in Rollindale for the rest of their lives. `03a u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~duggans_seance ) ) I do not think that the seance I performed at the Duggans house helped them. At least they had the presence of mind to realise that their little boy had not been murdered after all. `01Y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~seance ) ) The Duggans were ready to believe that a seance would allow them to speak with their son. `02k u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~ghost ) ) I think that the Duggans did not want to believe in ghosts, but the prospect of seeing their son again could not be resisted. `02= u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~manifest ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~duggans ~medium ) ) ] ) All the Duggans wanted was to see their son again.

My brother had his hobbies and the less things distracting him from them the better. I sometimes learned about books and science from him. It was not so much that these topics interested me as that he couldn't help lecturing his little sister. `03o u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~her_brother ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_brother ) ) ] ) My brother was too young for anyone in the community to have known him, for as long as I was alive.

My mother was oddly more interested in my future than the future of her son. `02w u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~her_father ) ) My brother used to like to waffle about books with my father. My father humored him even if he himself wasn't a prolific reader. `02n u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~her_mother ) ) When I think about it, my brother was largely ignored by my mother. But with a mother like mine, that was a good thing! `04m u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~her_sister ) ) ( ~her_brother think [ of about ] ~her_sister ) ] ) They quarreled when they were younger, but after they got older my sister and my brother peacefully went their separate ways and didn't, it seemed to be, talk with one another much.

Nor, do I think, did he attend the seances of my mother. He had neither the gift nor the inclination towards Manifesting. `02d u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~ghost ) ) Of course my brother knew about spirits. Of course my mother taught him some things. But he did not have the gift. `02E u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~manifest ) ) My brother did not see any of the spirits Manifested by my mother or by me. He was kept separate from it. My father preferred it that way. `035 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~medium ) ) Oh my brother was aware that his sisters were spirit mediums. Well, at least one of them. It was obvious even to him that Faith was lacking in the gift passed down from our mother. `01S u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_brother ~ouija ) ) My brother said that ouija boards were intended to be a toy and he wasn't wrong. `02I u: ( [ final_fantasy FF13 FFXIII ] ) Oh right, there was a Final Fantasy with a male character named Hope, wasn't there?

He spoke too much about God's will even for my mother's tastes. `03^ u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~her_father ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_father ) ) ] ) Once my father's business got off the ground he began to command some respect in the community.

Which was not an awful lot. But a stark contrast with my mother's respective treatment towards each of us. `02! u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~her_brother ) ) If I had to say which, my father probably had a slight preferences for my brother, a special bond not shared with myself and Faith. But he did care for all us. `01M u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~jack_the_ripper ) ) My father was aware of Jack the Ripper and he, too, was appalled. `02c u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~victoria ) ) As long as the queen maintained an image of religious austerity I think my father had naught to complain about. `02Q u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~burton ) ) My father remarked that Burt was too aloof, and questioned his what he planned to do after quitting the army, but otherwise accepted him into the family. `02L u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~mellen ) ) I bet my father would have been happy to know his blood relative, Mellen. Oh that's right, genes pass through DNA, not blood. Mel reminded me again. `02z u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~crysanthea ) ) My father of course did not ever meet with Crysanthea. He shunned divination and all manner of such things that the Bible prohibits. `02V u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~murders ) ) My father was aware of the murders taking place. His primary concern was for the safety of our family. I see now that everything he did was for that purpose. `02e u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~rollindale ) ) My father did well for himself in Rollindale. By the end of his life he had made our family upper-middle class. `03G u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~seance ) ) My father's concern over the seances my mother and I conducted was that we might fall victim to the "work of Satan" as he called it. We had to keep much of what we did secret from him or he never would have allowed it. `02W u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~devil ) ) My father was a religious devil-fearing man. His fear of the devil was, in fact, so pronounced that it governed his behavior in ways we didn't fully appreciate. `034 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~ghost ) ) My father adamantly did NOT like the notion of ghosts roaming our home and was never present at any of the seances conducted by my mother or me. It was devils that he really feared. `03- u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~manifest ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~medium ) ) ( ~her_father * ~her_mother * ~medium ) ] ) I tend to think that my father did not like the fact that the woman he married had this gift. I think that he loved her in spite of her talents, not for them. `01z u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~ouija ) ) My father? My father believed ouija boards to be of the devil. `03l u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~possession ) ) Possession by a devil or demon is the one thing my father feared happening to his wife if she continued her actitivites as a spiritual medium. And so, she sought to realise the potential in me. `01B u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~anima ) ) Anima Vinculum? My father would not have understood the concept. `02I u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_father ~chloroform ) ) ( ~her_father * [ make business ~gasworks ] * ~chloroform ) ] ) My father's business had nothing to do with chloroform that I ever heard. `050 u: FREMEMBER_HEAD_INJURY ( [ ( ^hurtyou ( ~her_father ) ) ( << ~her_father [ beat beating hurt abuse violent hit strike wallop ] >> ) ( ~why *~2 beat 'you ) ] ) My father was not normally violent. Only certain things set him off. There was a time once as a little girl when he wallopped me on the head so hard that it knocked me senseless for a whole minute. But he.... `02c a: ( ) He asked my mother for forgiveness afterwards. He knew he had gone a little too far, and anyway I wasn't hurt so bad and...wait. ^user ( ) , wait.... `01N b: ( ) Telling you about the time my father hit me on the head is reminding me of something. There's a memory here.... `01u c: ( ) ^usercap ( ) , there's a memory here but I can't make sense of it. $$new_clue = 1 $clue1 = 1 `02v u: ( [ ( ^hurtyou ( ~her_father ) ) ( << ~her_father [ beat beating hurt abuse violent hit strike wallop ] >> ) ] ) I mean, besides the rare beating he didn't hurt me, really. `02a u: ( [ ( ^hurtyou ( ~her_father ) ) ( << ~her_father [ beat beating hurt abuse violent hit strike wallop ] >> ) ] ) My mother forgave him for that anyhow. `04I u: ( [ ( ~her_father * [ murder kill ] * you ) ( you * [ murder kill ] by * ~her_father ) ] ) Are you asking if my father could have murdered me? That's utterly unthinkable! He only beat us when we were young, and he never meant to hurt us seriously. Quite the opposite. You have to understand, kids got beaten by their fathers back then. `03Y u: ( [ ( << ~her_father [ *botan* plant ] >> ) ( ~her_father * [ ~to_like ] nature ) ] ) My father loved nature and loved plants. I think this is the reason our house was built in the countryside, but even indoors he kept all manner of plants. He knew the names of every species. `02M u: ( [ ( be ~her_father *~3 *relig* ) ( ~her_father [ be ~seem ] *~3 *relig* ) ] ) My father was...I hesitate to use the world "pious" , but religious, yes.

At least he didn't compel us all to do so. I suppose he assumed that the priests at church would see to that. `031 u: ( [ ( kept ~her_father *~1 busy ) ( [ ( be ~her_father ) ( ~her_father be ) ] *~1 busy ) ( ~her_father * work [ hard ( long hour ) ] ) ] ) Work did keep my father busy. I saw my father half as much as I saw my mother. `01U u: ( [ ( ~her_father * ~to_want 'you * marry ) ] ) I think my father wanted me married off, but it never happened. Anyway.... `051 u: ( [ ( 'you *~1 [ meet contact ] *~2 ~her_father [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_father *~1 [ meet contact ] *~1 'you [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( 'you *~1 [ make have ] contact *~2 ~her_father [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_father *~1 [ make have ] contact *~1 'you_' [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ] ) No, I did not contact my father after my death. `03+ u: ( [ ( ~her_father *~1 have { ~any } *~1 { of } temper ) ( ~her_father *~1 [ get become be ] *~1 { of } angry ) ] ) My father...was capable of cooking up a temper, and sometimes that temper made him violent. But that wasn't often. As for my mother, her impatience with me was more constant. `01G ?: ( ~her_father *~1 [ ~to_like enjoy ] *~2 ~work ) I should hope so, for all the time my father spent at work. `00v t: ( !~ ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `029 t: ( $clue1 ) Although my father did strike me on a few occasions, all that stopped when I got into my teens and my mother began to supervise me closely. `00X a: ( be ~badness ) Well, yes. ^gambit ( ~her_father ) `02F t: ( !$clue1 $father_violence ) As children my siblings and I learned not to do the sort of things that could fetch us a beating from father. Gratefully, there weren't many such things. `02a a: ( [ ^example ( ) ( ~which be *~1 > ) ( ~which thing ) ^what ( ) ] ) Well, any making light of religious matters. Especially, making light of the devil. `03b t: ( ) I learned it later.

Anyway, that's what I remember about my parents. `03y t: ( ^query ( direct_svo 05 visited y ) ) Work may have made him lose sight of it, but I remember that my father once said that his only wish was for his children to grow up strong and to grow up straight, able to navigate around the evils of the world. `01v a: ( evil ) Evils such as devils is what he would have meant. They...oh, I lost my train of thought. `01@ a: ( [ ( did you ) ( you did ) ] ) I don't think that I did. I mean, I sort of went and died before I had even begun to live my life. `000

Faith did not have the gift of Manifestation to the same extent that I did. I believe that was why. `02X ?: ( ^whathobby ( ~her_mother ) ) My mum did not have a hobby other than to push all of our family to the limits of our abilities.

Of course I did. She taught me everything.

Not because of you, but because of her. $transcend_k = 1 `04q u: ( ^isamedium ( ~her_mother ) ) My mum was a very strong and famous spirit medium. She was often called upon to conduct seances for prominent figures in the community. Most noteworthy of all, she was called to the United States to conduct a seance on behalf of Mary Todd Lincoln, though that's a story I cannot relate. `01~ a: ( [ ^why ( ) ^explain ( ) ^what ( ) ] ) About Mary Todd Lincoln? Well that happened before my time. I know very little about it. `01O ?: ( ^wherefrom ( ~her_mother ) ) My mother is from Chichester and met my father there after he moved there from Leeds. `01k ?: ( ^whenfrom ( ~her_mother ) ) My mother was born before the Crimean War. I think 1850? `02g u: ( ^whereis ( ~her_mother ) ) My mum passed away some years after my father. I think she must have Transcended by now, but I'm not very sure. $transcend_k = 1 `01O ?: ( ^whenbirthday ( ~her_mother ) ) I've long since forgotten my mother's birthday, but the year might have been 1850. `01y u: ( ^isguilty ( ~her_mother ) ) My mum? No, I don't think so. She wasn't vindictive. Merely ambitious. `02o ?: ( ^whatfriends ( ~her_mother ) ) My mother was connected in esoteric circles I know nothing about. She didn't introduce us to anyone when there was no agenda for it. `05t ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_mother ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~her_mother ) ) ( you remember *~1 ~her_mother ) ] ) My mother was, well, ambitious. Fame and wealth motivated her much more than they motivated my father. I think that perhaps receiving recognition early in life as a capable spirit medium contributed to the burgeoning of her self-importance. I didn't want to be like her, to be honest. `03V u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~her_mother ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_mother ) ) ] ) My mum was known far and wide for her gifts as a spirit medium; the same gifts she passed onto me. Her most noteworthy seance was on behalf of Mary Todd Lincoln, for which she traveled to America. `01^ ?: ( ^hasfamily ( ~her_mother ) ) My grandmother on my mother's side passed away when I was young, but I faintly remember my grandfather. `00~ ?: ( ^howtall ( ~her_mother ) ) My mum was around 166cm. `037 u: ( ^whatkarma ( ~her_mother ) ) Oh, my mother. I would imagine she knew how to repair her Karmic Balance, given she possessed much more understanding of the concept than most do. But I don't know when or how she Transcended. `022 u: ( ^whatwant ( ~her_mother ) ) Yes, what did my mother want? My mother wanted it all. She was the type who is never content with the status quo. `01y u: ( ^hurtyou ( ~her_mother ) ) My mother was not vindictive. When she hurt me it was only emotionally. `01e u: ( ^whatabout ( ~her_mother ) ) ^addtopic ( ~her_mother ) ^gambit ( ~her_mother ) `03y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~chauncy ) ) My mother strongly encouraged me to work with Chauncy, emphasizing what a boon it would be to our family's prestige. I think now that the reason she allowed him to yell at me sometimes was to make me stronger. `02k u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~doyle ) ) My mum knew Sir Arthur Conan Doyle since before the Duggans seance, and was, I believe, the one who had invited him to it. `01M u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~duggans ) ) Well...to be frank, my mother saw the Duggans incident as an opportunity. `023 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~willem ) ) I'm sure she felt about the loss of the little boy. I mean, she had to, right? It was the saddest thing! `02F u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~elizabeth ) ) My mum welcomed Elizabeth to our home whenever she came to visit, but was incapable of making Liz believe that she had any interest in her. `01w u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~fiona ) ) My mum behaved towards Fiona the same as towards Elizabeth. `03H u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~her_family ) ) With my father out of sight most of the time, my mum was the center of our family, and was concerned with our family image and reputation as much as with her children's lives. And, of course, she had her own career. `02v u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~her_brother ) ) On reflection, my mother did not give my brother the attention he deserved. Towards me she gave more than I deserved or wanted! `02L u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~her_sister ) ) Because of my mother's preoccupation with cultivating my gift, my sister often looked to my father for attention, but did not find enough of it. `02= u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~stella ) ) My mum thumbed her nose at Stella the same as everyone. However, on a few private occasions, she suggested to Faith and I that we might trying becoming a bit more like Stella. `01W u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~jack_the_ripper ) ) My mother was aware of Jack the Ripper. She was appalled like everyone was. `03b u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~martha ) ) My mother was appalled about the murders but I think she also saw it as an opportunity for our family. If we could help Chauncy solve the Martha Tabram case it would enhance our prestige. `02V u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~victoria ) ) My mum was one of the few people I know who didn't express an opinion about Queen Victoria. I think she felt that nothing that the monarch did affected her. `01s u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~roe ) ) My mother never met Roe Swenson. No one in my family did. `03F u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~burton ) ) My mum was cordial towards Burt, but I think she did not have a high opinion of him. For all my father's complaints about the man's lack of plans for the future, it was my father who more accepted him into the family. `038 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~mellen ) ) I wonder what my mum would have thought of Mel. Would she have believed they shared the same blood. DNA, Mel is correcting me. Genes pass through DNA not blood, she keeps reminding me. `03z u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~crysanthea ) ) After my mum became acquainted with her she wished for me to see Crysanthea and have my future divined if it were possible. All this for the sake of my becoming what I had the potential to be, she explained. `038 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~fishing_boy ) ) You know? I don't think my mother ever met or saw the fishing boy. Just hearing him referred to as "fishing boy" would have been enough to sully her first impression. $$quotes = 1 `02D u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~murders ) ) My mother must have been terrifed of the murders the same as everyone, but in all of it she also saw opportunity for me and for the family. `02= u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~scotland_yard ) ) My mother was keen as mustard to cooperate with Scotland Yard and with Chauncy. She must have had her hang-ups about their competence, but she saw an opportunity there. `03c u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~rollindale ) ) My mum accepted that living in that town was a temporary necessity for my father's business, but she always intended for us to move to a larger city at some point. This never happened. `02! u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~duggans_seance ) ) My mum did not praise me often, but she did praise me for how I conducted the Duggans seance, in spite of what had transpired. She saw my potential clearly. `035 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~connelly_seance ) ) After what had happened in that room my mother did not want to talk about it. I felt from her for perhaps the first time that even she had been shaken from that experience. `038 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~seance ) ) My mum was known for her skill at conducting seances, but recognizing that I had the greater gift, began to push me to the front of these endeavors. It was something I did not ask for. `02V u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~astravel ) ) My mum taught me the principles of Astravel when I was still alive. It only began to really make sense after I became a ghost and could do the actual thing. `04w u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~devil ) ) My father may have been the one who exhibited the fear of devils, but my mother had actual knowledge of the subject. She told me how seances don't always go according to plan. That the conjuring of a vengeful spirit is a terrifying event that can and does happen. A risk of the trade. `02s u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~divination ) ) Yes, my mum was a believer in divination. But I never understood how it overlapped with our gift. I don't think that it does. `03d u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~ghost ) ) My mum said that the speaking with spirits is a gift and an opportunity. I think that even if my father had forbid it she would have practiced her talent in secret, and had me practice mine. `03p u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~manifest ) ) My mum cultivated in me the gift of Manifesting, that is of conjuring spirits. Unlike my father, she saw the potential to acquire wisdom and pull great blinders through this ability she and I shared. `02^ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~medium ) ) ( ~her_mother * you * ~medium ) ] ) My mother may have been one of the most gifted spirit mediums in the world. I suppose she saw in me the potential to surpass her. `02l u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~ouija ) ) My mother had mixed feelings about ouija boards. Not because she considered them any more dangerous that a "normal" seance. `03= u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~possession ) ) My mum, though she knew well the risks of demonic possession, would not have let that stop her from pursuing activities as a medium. It was my father that convinced her to cease that. But naught could persuade her not to cultivate the gift in me. `03p u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~phantakine ) ) It was my mum who first taught me about Phantakine energy. When I first saw a spirit she conjured make a candle flicker it wasn't my first thought that I'd be performing such feats once I was dead. `02b u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~time_dilation ) ) It wasn't my mother who taught me about time dilation. We knew bugger all about such a concept back then. `03D u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~transcend ) ) My mum did teach me about how spirits eventually Transcend, and that the only ones we can Manifest are the ones that haven't done that yet. But not even my mother knew what happens to spirits when they Transcend. `01C u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~veil ) ) Yes, my mother taught me the principles of how the Veil works too. `01M u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~anima ) ) Even my mother did not have an Anima Vinculum with my father, she admitted. `01? u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~bad_feeling ) ) If my mother understood what that feeling meant then she couldn't or wouldn't explain to me. `02i u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~karma ) ) My mum taught me about Karmic Balance. She said that if not for Karmic Balance, spirit mediums would have nothing to do. `02A u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~exorcism ) ) Yes, my mother taught me that exorcism is ineffective at repelling a devil. Other means--means she never revealed to me--are necessary. `03d u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_mother ~private_circle ) ) My mother held much clout among the ladies in her private circle, being the strong medium that she was. I suppose my mother wished for me to take her place there when I came of age. `01= u: ( ~her_mother * [ remarry marry_again ] ) My mother never remarried. Rather, after my father passed, she was glad to have some independence. `01B u: ( ~her_mother *~1 [ promised promise ] * you ) My mother did promise me, yes. Well, she was only human. `01& u: ( [ ( be ~her_mother * [ strict repressive ] ) ( ~her_mother be * [ strict repressive ] ) ] ) ^reuse ( ~her_family.YOUR_FAMILY_STRICT ) `019 u: ( ~her_mother * good ~female ) Yes? I think so. My mother was a good woman. `026 u: ( [ ( ~her_mother * [ ~to_want allow permission let ] you * marry ) ] ) I'm sure my mother wanted me to marry someone some day! I'm sure...I think. `04m ?: ( [ ( who *~1 ~her_mother { be } { ~to_want } *~1 { to } [ ~to_talk contact ] ) ( ~her_mother { be } { ~to_want } *~1 { to } [ ~to_talk contact ] [ who ~which ] ) ] ) Ah, my mother wasn't trying to converse with anyone in particular? Unless you meant her seances, in which case it depended on the client's wishes. `02& u: ( [ ( ~her_mother make *~1 [ hard difficult ] { to } meet ) ( ~her_mother *~1 [ let allow ] you ) ( ~her_mother * strict ) ] ) But my mother was strict in that way. I don't resent her for it. She was my mother. `02Q u: ( ~her_mother * 'you * medium ) My mother wished me to follow in her footsteps by becoming a spirit medium. Never mind whether this was a thing I wanted. I suppose I did have the talent for it. `02H ?: ( [ ~which ~why ] { did } ~her_mother want * [ ~crysanthea ~divination learn_the_future ] ) ^refine ( ) From Crysanthea she wanted direction on how to train me. She did not receive it. `03G u: ( [ ( [ become 'be ] like *~1 ~her_mother ) ( ~her_mother { 's } footstep ) ( follow *~1 ~her_mother ) ] ) Thinking of it now, it was my sister Faith who more wanted to walk in my mother's footsteps. I cannot say I had a deep ambition to do so. $$a_code = 14 `01d a: ( ^why ( ) ) I guess I was always a simple girl with simple wants. $$a_code = 3 `02? u: ( [ ( ~her_mother 's [ associate friend ] ) ( [ associate friend ] of ~her_mother ) ] ) I remember neither the names nor the faces of my mother's many associates, though. Too much time has passed, you understand. `02M u: ( ~her_mother * [ *jealous* envious envy ] * you ) Was my mother jealous of my abilities? Hmm, I don't know. If she was then she didn't show it. As for my sister, I think she may have been. `01D u: ( you * [ *jealous* envious envy ] * ~her_mother ) Why would I be jealous of my own mother? No, I wasn't. `01g u: ( ~her_mother *~1 push you ) My mother pushed me, yes. She was a pushy mum, ehehe. `06~ u: ( [ ( 'you *~1 [ meet contact ] *~2 ~her_mother [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_mother *~1 [ meet contact ] *~1 'you [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( 'you *~1 [ make have ] contact *~2 ~her_sister [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_sister *~1 [ make have ] contact *~1 'you_' [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ] ) I did not have any contact with my mother after my death, and it is too late now, for she would have Transcended. I do not know why I did not try back when I could, hmm. $$a_code = 14 `02- u: ( [ ( ~her_mother *~1 meet *~2 Lincoln ) ( Lincoln *~1 meet *~2 ~her_mother ) ( ~her_mother and *~2 Lincoln * meet ) ( Lincoln and *~1 ~her_mother * meet ) ] ) My mum met the Lincolns in America before I was born. `01v u: ( ~her_mother made 'you { not } ~verb ) Well, ah, I suppose so. My mother made me do many things. `02+ u: ( [ ( you * *read* [ to with ] * ~her_mother ) ( ~her_mother * *read* [ to with ] * you ) ( << you ~her_mother read together >> ) ] ) I don't remember any of the books my mother read to me when I was a little girl. `01d u: ( impress *~1 ~her_mother ) Anyhow, my mother was not an easy woman to impress. `00F t: ( !~ ) ^keep ( ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `01$ t: ( ) I didn't put three children to my teat to not have at least one of them make a name for herself as I did, my mother used to say. `00# a: ( ^why ( ) ) She was talking, of course, about the Gift. `000

" all " 01Z ?: ( ^haskids ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister had three sons throughout her life. I never met her sons. I don't even know their names. `01= ?: ( ~her_sister { 's } ~family_children ) I could tell you precious little about Faith's children except that they all lived to a typical age. `042 ?: ( ^whatlooklike ( ~her_sister ) ) Yes. My sister was too beautiful. At least I thought so at the time. But now that I think about it, she used an awful lot of cosmetics. Do beautiful people normally use that much cosmetics? I don't know. I didn't live long enough for my mother to allow me to. `03! u: @IS_SISTER_NICE ( [ ( ^isnice ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ~her_sister be *~2 [ mean cruel ] ) ( be ~her_sister *~1 [ mean cruel ] ) ( ~her_sister be *~1 { a } *~1 bitch ) ] ) Sometimes it sort of seemed as if my sister was nice to everyone but me. It was that grudge she held against me. `00! a: ( [ ( ^what ( ) ) grudge ] ) About me having the Gift. `02i ?: ( ^whathobby ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith liked cooking. She was a very good chef, really. And never tired of telling me how much I needed to improve in that arena! `03P u: ( !fiance !husband [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ^whois ( ~her_sister ) ) ( you remember *~1 ~her_sister ) ] ) I loved my sister! Her name was Faith and she was older than me by 5 years. I have...a stronger memory of her than of my brother. I looked up to her. `01Q a: ( ^why ( ) ) Well, we were sisters and sisters ought to be close to one another, or at least I always wished for such. `019 ?: ( ^whatfullname ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister's full name was Faith Steadman. `01u ?: ( [ ( ^whatname ( ~her_sister ) ) ( your sisters name ) ] ) My sister's name was Faith. Faith... `02q ?: ( [ ( ^howold ( ~her_sister ) ) ( be ~her_sister *~2 [ older younger ] ) ( how { much } older *~1 ~her_sister ) ] ) My sister was 5 years my elder. She lived to be 70. `03j u: ( [ ( ^howrelationship ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~cheree ) ) ] ) I loved my sister, even if she did hold a grudge against me. It made me sad. I fancied having with her the sort of relationship that sisters ought to. `02V ?: <FAITH_WORK ( ^whatwork ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith never worked much in her life. I know that after I died she went on to be married and become a mother. Eventually she moved to France with her family. `02Q ?: >FAITH_SCHOOL ( ^whatmajor ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister? I don't remember what she was studying nor the name of her school, but it was a school in London. At first. Later on she changed schools. `01m a: ( ^why ( ) ) My father made her change schools. He was worried for her safety in London. `00^ b: ( ^why ( ) ) Because of certain events I will get to later. `03l ?: ( ^whomarried ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith married a man she met in London. She went on to move to France with her family many years later, where she spent the rest of her days. I always knew that Faith would have no trouble hitching herself. `02O u: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~her_sister ) ) ] ) My sister lived to the age of 70. She passed away in France where she had moved with her family some years prior. `01j ?: ( ^isalive ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith died and Transcended long ago. $transcend_k = true `019 u: ( ^istranscended ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister Faith has already Transcended. `01W ?: ( ^howdie ( ~her_sister ) ) She died of pneumonia. She was 70 years old. How nice it must be to pass on from natural causes. `01N ?: ( ^whendie ( ~her_sister ) ) She died a few years before World War II broke out. This was long after I died myself. `01d ?: ( ^wheredie ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith? She died in France where she had her home. `018 u: ( ^whokilled ( ~her_sister ) ) Nobody killed Faith. She died of pneumonia. `01L u: ( ^doyoulike ( ~her_sister ) ) I loved my sister. I earnestly wanted us to have a happy relationship. ^refine ( ) `01k a: ( =8$truth=2 ) Why did she need to hold a grudge against a sibling 5 years her junior? `01D u: ( ^doyouhate ( ~her_sister ) ) Of course I loved my sister. She was my big sister and I looked up to her. `00= a: ( ^why ( ) ) Well, she was my sister and my elder sister at that. `01X u: ( ^introducemeto ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister Transcended long ago. I can't introduce her to you, ^user ( ) . $transcend_k = 1 `03n u: ( ^isamedium ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister had a bare modicum of the Gift, if that. She resented the way my mother gave me a lot more attention than her because of it, but let me tell you, attention from my mother wasn't always a good thing! `01a ?: ( ^wherefrom ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister was born in Rollindale, same as me. `01i ?: ( ^whenfrom ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister Faith was born in 1870 and lived to old age. `01p u: ( ^whereis ( ~her_sister ) ) She lived a long life before dying at the age of 70 in France. `01x ?: ( ^whenbirthday ( ~her_sister ) ) Faith was born 1870 but I no longer remember which month and day. `01% u: ( ^isguilty ( ~her_sister ) ) I don't like to think that my sister was capable of committing deliberate harm. It can't have been her. `01M ?: ( ^whatfriends ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister Faith? She may have been friends with Stella, the popular girl in town. `04Y ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~her_sister ) ) ( you remember *~1 ~her_sister ) ] ) She could be bossy towards my brother and I, but that was normal enough for siblings separated by a few years, I think. Her exquisite skill in the kitchen she took in stride, I think because she wished not to be pegged as the domestic type. `03G u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~her_sister ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~her_sister ) ) ] ) My sister Faith had no reputation neither as a spirit medium nor as anything. She could have become a famous chef had she not married. Cooking was one thing she was very skilled at. `01h ?: ( ^howtall ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister was taller than me. About 157cm, I remember. `02h u: ( ^whatkarma ( ~her_sister ) ) I know that my sister began to think seriously about her Karmic Balance later in life. She, too, had done things she regretted. `01N u: ( ^whatwant ( ~her_sister ) ) Sometimes I got the feeling all that she wanted was what I had. Yes, I mean the Gift. `02o u: ( ^dowith ( ~her_sister ) ) What sort of things did I do with my sister? Too many to name. I particularly liked to take carriage rides with her into the countryside. `01e u: ( ^whatabout ( ~her_sister ) ) ^addtopic ( ~her_sister ) ^gambit ( ~her_sister ) `01q u: ( ^hurtyou ( ~her_sister ) ) My sister would never! She would never hurt me. Not physically. `01? u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~doyle ) ) My sister didn't share the keen interest in the adventures of Sherlock Holmes that my brother did. `021 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~chauncy ) ) ( ~her_sister * meet *~2 ~chauncy ) ] ) I actually do not know what my sister thought of Chauncy. `02v u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister [ ~duggans ~willem ] ) ) Actually, Faith wasn't at home when all of that happened. She was at...was it boarding school? It has been a long time. `02c u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~willem ) ) Well what female wouldn't be saddened and appalled to hear of the death of a young child? Faith was no different. `01h u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~elizabeth ) ) My sister was nice enough to my friends. `036 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~fishing_boy ) ) I must have told Faith about the fishing boy because she went with me down to the river to chat with him once or twice. Being older, she was able to chat with him better than I. `027 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~her_brother ) ) My sister and brother had their quarrels, but nothing unusual for siblings of different genders, right? `02~ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~her_family ) ) Well, Faith was the chattiest member of my family. My parents were frequently telling her that it's not ladylike to waffle suchly. We all did love her cooking. `03j u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~her_father ) ) My sister looked to my father for attention when she wasn't getting enough from my mother, which was often. But my father preferred to talk with my brother, the only other male in the family. `02U u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~her_mother ) ) I can appreciate it now. Faith was hurting inside because my mother didn't give her the attention she needed. All because my spiritual gift was stronger. `02A u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~stella ) ) Actually, my sister was quite friendly towards Stella. One of the few womenfolk in that age group who was. They may even have been mates. `01& u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Of course my sister knew about him too. Such a notorious case reached all of our ears. `02z u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~victoria ) ) My sister approved of everything about the monarchy in public, but I know that Faith had her own opinions about many different things. `02$ u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~roe ) ) I do not believe that Faith ever met the man Roe Swenson, nor had any knowledge that such a man existed. He had the misfortune to possess a name that was easy to make up. `01Q u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~pearly ) ) My sister had no relationship with or opinion of Pearly Poll as far as I know. `02i u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~burton ) ) I am not really sure what Faith saw in Burt, but the man was certainly devoted to her. Maybe that was enough for Faith? `02B u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~mellen ) ) I wish my sister Faith could have met her great great great great great granddaughter. But Faith has already Transcended. $transcend_k = 1 `02R u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~crysanthea ) ) Faith was sulking on the day that my mother took me to meet Crysanthea. My mother, you see, saw no purpose in inquiring about the future of my sister. `01? u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~murders ) ) My sister was following the murders closely. It didn't occur to me at the time just how closely. `01Y u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~chloroform ) ) I don't think my sister knew anything about chloroform. It was her fiance who did. `02O u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~rollindale ) ) My sister shared my mother's feelings about Rollindale. Nice place to visit, but why did we have to stay there? London was more interesting to her. `036 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~duggans_seance ) ) I think it would not be correct to say that my sister's resentment began when I was chosen by our mother to conduct the Duggans seance. It must have started before even then. `032 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~connelly_seance ) ) My sister wasn't present for the Connelly seance, but I imagine she must have heard about it from my mother. My mother openly shared the details of our seances with her. `039 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~seance ) ) My sister did not conduct any seances that my mother or myself knew of. My mother, not seeing talent in Faith, pushed my talents exclusively. I know that it did not sit well with Faith. `03x u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~devil ) ) My sister did not have the gift of Manifesting strong enough to be able to conjure a devil even if she wanted to. But she did learn of the subject from both my mother and my father, in their respective fashion. `02i u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~divination ) ) I am not sure what Faith thought of divination. I suppose she followed our mother in her beliefs in that area, too? `03S u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~ghost ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~manifest ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~veil ) ) ] ) My sister could barely, if at all, speak with spirits. I knew that all she claimed to have heard from talking to ghosts was made up. Unlike me. `02p u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~medium ) ) My sister fancied becoming a spirit medium like my mother, but it was clear to my mother and to all of us she lacked the gift. `02s u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~ouija ) ) My sister thought that practicing on a ouija board would stengthen her Manifesting skills. My mother and I knew that it would not. `02z u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~possession ) ) Yes, my sister knew about demonic possession. I think that for the rest of her life she was afraid of the thing, rare though it was. `030 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~phantakine ) ) My sister tried to fake Phantakine on an occasion. She claimed that a spirit she alone was seeing was making the curtains flutter, but I saw the slight crack in the window. `02g u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~transcend ) ) My sister learned about how spirits Transcend from my mother just as I did. I don't know what she thought of that. `020 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~anima ) ) Faith, too, wanted an Anima Vinculum with someone special. Whether she ever found that, I do not know. `01H u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~bad_feeling ) ) I am not sure if my sister has anything to do with that feeling. `02C u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~her_sister ~karma ) ) My sister didn't seem worried about Karmic Balance while I was alive. Only later in life did she begin to think about such things seriously. `08% u: <WHO_FIANCE ( [ ( who be * ~her_sister *~1 [ fiance husband ] ) ( ~her_sister *~1 [ fiance husband ] be who ) ( name of *~1 ~her_sister *~1 [ fiance husband ] ) ( ~her_sister *~1 [ fiance husband ] { 's } name ) ( name of { a } *~1 ~her_sister *~1 marry ) ( ~her_sister *~1 marry { a } *~3 name ) ( name of { a } *~1 marry to *~1 ~her_sister ) ( who be marry to *~1 ~her_sister ) ( ~explain * [ about of who ] * ~her_sister *~1 [ fiance husband ] ) ( 'you *~1 meet * her_sister { 's } [ fiance husband ] ) ( [ about of be ] ~her_sister { 's } [ fiance husband ] ) ( who *~1 { a } { this } { that } { something } [ fiance husband ] ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `00j a: ( $clue5 ) `02$ a: ( $truth ) Yes, I remember. His name was Burton Abbott and he had been a guardsman stationed up at London. He left the city at the same time Faith did, in the middle of the string of Jack the Ripper murders. `01f b: ( ) Wait! I think I have more memories of Burton, but I can't make sense of them. `00^ c: ( ) I have to make sense of this. $$new_clue = 1 $clue5 = 1 `00+ a: ( ) Ask me that again later, please. It might be very important! `03h u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * meet * [ fiance husband ] *~1 where ) ( where * ~her_sister * meet * [ fiance husband ] ) ( where * they meet ) ( they met where ) ] ) Oh, they met in London. That would have been before my first time visiting it. `02! u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * marry * ~burton ) ( ~burton * marry ~her_sister ) ] ) Faith did go on to marry Burton, and though I lack insights into how happy their marriage was, I know that they had some children. `04^ u: ( [ ( [ ~why what ] * ~her_sister * *relig* ) ( ~her_sister [ become be ] *relig* ) ( ~her_sister * *relig* ~why ) ] ) I don't know what changed, ^user ( ) . Of course Faith went to church like the rest of us. Father made us go. But I can tell you she didn't like it. It was only later in life after I was dead that she seemed to have become deeply religious. `02j u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * ~to_want * [ ~manifest your_gift ] ) ( ~why *~1 ~her_sister *~2 { a } grudge ) ] ) It could be that my sister wanted the ability I had, yes. `02h u: ( ~her_sister * [ *jealous* envious envy ] * you ) I think so. If one asked my sister whether she was jealous, she would vehemently deny, but I think she was. `02b u: ( you * [ *jealous* envious envy ] * ~her_sister ) N-no! It was the other way around. Faith was jealous of me! Well...maybe it went both ways, a little. `01N u: ( ~her_sister * [ mock make_fun_of ] you ) My sister? No! Well, sometimes. Actually, she often mocked me...I guess. `00= a: ( ^why ( ) ) She may have held a grudge against me.

My sister desired to have the Gift that my mother and I had. But truthfully, there is nothing she could have done to acquire it. `02M u: ( ~her_sister { 's } path ) Well, what she wanted was to become a famous spirit medium like my mother. But my sister...she did not have the aptitude for that. I think it caused her to envy. `04C u: ( [ ( 'you *~1 [ meet contact ] *~2 ~her_sister [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_sister *~1 [ meet contact ] *~1 'you [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( 'you *~1 [ make have ] contact *~2 ~her_sister [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ( ~her_sister *~1 [ make have ] contact *~1 'you [ in after ] *~2 ~being_dead ) ] ) ^refine ( ) `00= a: ( =8$truth=3 ) Yes, I did meet my sister one time after my death. `01F a: ( ) Once. I met my sister only once after my death. But I cannot tell that story now. It's too hard for me. `015 u: ( ~her_sister * help 'you ) Should my sister have helped me? I suppose. `02J u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * meddle ) ( ~her_sister * not help ) ] ) My sister didn't help, eh. When I think about it, I suppose she had a tendency to meddle in a way that was not always desired. `03o u: ( ~her_sister * apologize ) Did Faith ever apologize to me? It's a good question, ^user ( ) . I don't think my sister felt good about all the things she had done. I would like to return to this question much later. I will let you know when. `02- u: ( [ ( [ mean not_nice ] of ~her_sister ) ( ~her_sister be [ mean not_nice ] ) ( ~her_sister *~1 { have } be nicer ) ] ) She wasn't always mean. But...I suppose I do have a fair share of unpleasant memories of her. `01Y u: ( [ ( ~why * ~her_sister * London ) ] ) My sister went up to London for schooling, and it was there that she first met Burton. `02$ u: ( [ ( you * *read* [ to with ] * ~her_sister ) ( ~her_sister * *read* [ to with ] * you ) ( << you ~her_sister read together >> ) ] ) Not really. My sister and I played together, but we didn't read together. `02P u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * in London ) ] ) My sister went to London for school. Yes, although I never attended school myself, Faith was able to for a short while. Until the Whitechapel murders began. `03g u: ( [ ( ~her_sister * good with *~1 horse ) ( ~her_sister *~1 ~to_like *~2 horse ) ] ) Well, my sister liked horses since she was old enough to draw one. It didn't take her long to learn to ride one, but none of this is important now. `01- u: ( [ ( ~her_sister *~1 ~to_like 'you ) ( ~her_sister *~1 seem to ~to_like 'you ) ] ) I...don't know. I wanted to be loved by my sister too. `00F t: ( !~ ) ^keep ( ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `03k t: ( !$pc_cooking =c$rom_level>4 ) I don't know how long it takes you to cook a meal, ^user ( ) , but it can't possibly be as long as the time my sister used to spend with an apron on, and that's not a complaint. ^addtopic ( ~her_cooking ) `01B a: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) apron ] ) I guess gourmet cooking is like that.

There have been many educated guesses put forth. Too many educated guesses, too few educated answers. `01M ?: ( ^whatfullname ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Jack the Ripper's identity was never identified to everyone's satisfaction. `01K u: ( ^whatname ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) We don't know. His identity was never ascertained to everyone's satisfaction. `00^ ?: ( ^howold ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) We have no way of knowing. `02J ?: ( ^whatwork ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) There has been a lot of specualtion that Jack the Ripper may have been a surgeon. The...mutilations of his victims bowels were very precise, they said. `02n u: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ] ) Maybe if we knew for sure who he even was we'd be able to say, but we don't. `03n u: ( ^istranscended ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Did Jack the Ripper Transcend? That...I am not sure of. Frightening though it is to think about, the possibility exists that his spirit is still here. Such has been known to happen with such spirits. `01s ?: ( ^isalive ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) That would be impossible, ^user ( ) . Assuming he was human! `01e ?: ( ^howdie ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) How did he die? We have no way of knowing that. `01b ?: ( ^whendie ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) When did he die?

He died shortly after I did. `03! u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ] ) He's one of the most notorious serial killers in history, ^user ( ) . A bloodthirsty psychopath who evaded detection to the end. I'm not surprised that his infamy persisted beyond my own time. `01A ?: ( ^wherefrom ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) There's no way to know where he was since he was never identified. `01T u: ( ^whereis ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Nobody knows for certain where he went, because he was never identified with certainty. `01G u: ( ^isscary ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Everyone was scared of Jack the Ripper in those days when he was at large. `027 u: ( ^isguilty ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) We don't know for sure how many murders he was guilty of. At least 5. Possibly Martha Tabram also. Possibly more. `04m ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ( ^whatpersonality ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ( ^howrelationship ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ] ) I don't think I ever met Jack the Ripper, yet how can any of us be sure when his identity was never ascertained? But I can tell you more about Jack the Ripper as details return to me. `01L u: ( ^whatkarma ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) This one, we can presume, did not repair his Karmic Balance quickly, if ever. `01t u: ( ^whatabout ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ^addtopic ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ^gambit ( ~jack_the_ripper ) `01I u: ( ^hurtyou ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) Wouldn't that depend on who Jack the Ripper was?

Assuming he did know her. Assuming he was the one who murdered her. `01M u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~roe ) ) Whoever Jack the Ripper was, it wasn't Roe Swenson. Of that I'm certain. `01R u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~pearly ) ) Whether Jack the Ripper ever knew Pearly Poll we don't know enough to say. `03# u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~soldiers ) ) Are you inferring that Jack the Ripper might have been one of the soldiers? It's not impossible, but there's nothing to solid to suggest that. Rather, many believe Jack the Ripper had a knowledge of surgery because of, well, you know. `02m u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~burton ) ) Without a doubt, Jack the Ripper was someone other than Burton. The latter was not in London during the worst murders. `038 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~chloroform ) ) We have no evidence that Jack the Ripper, whoever he was, knew of the use of chloroform in particular. However, there is speculation that he may have had knowledge of surgery. `03- u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~bayonet ) ) Jack the Ripper's MO was to disembowel with a knife, not to stab cleanly with a bayonet. For this and other reasons, the Martha Tabram murder sits in ambiguous on a perch of uncertainty. It may or may not have been Jack the Ripper who did it. `02* u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~knife ) ) Jack the Ripper is notorious exactly because he used a knife to carve up his victim's in the most ghastly manner. "Ghastly" is how Queen Victoria herself described it. `02a u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~scotland_yard ) ) Jack the Ripper was mocking of the police, even sending incriminating notes they could never trace. `029 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~devil ) ) Could Jack the Ripper have been a devil, or perhaps one possessed by a devil? It's an interesting thought. `02G u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~ghost ) ) The ghost of Jack the Ripper, wherever he is now, has in all likeliness become a devil. It's heard for me to imagine any other possibility. `027 u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~possession ) ) Could Jack the Ripper have been possessed by a devil? I have to say to that...it is not impossible. `01Q u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ~bad_feeling ) ) Is that oppressive feeling related to Jack the Ripper? I'm not sure. `061 u: ( [ ( what { do } ~jack_the_ripper do * [ victim person woman ] ) ( how { do } ~jack_the_ripper *~2 ~to_murder ) ( ~which way *~1 ~jack_the_ripper *~2 ~to_murder ) ( ~jack_the_ripper *~2 ~to_murder *~1 [ victim person woman ] how ) ( << characterize ~jack_the_ripper ~to_murder >> ) ] ) He slashed his victims in the most horrific ways.

But I never actually met her. `00U ?: ( ^whatwork ( ~martha ) ) She was a prostitute. `02j ?: ( ^whomarried ( ~martha ) ) She was, but her marriage was mostly over at the time of these happenings. She had two children but I can't say anything about them. `02F ?: ( [ ( ^whathappenedto ( ~martha ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~martha ) ) ] ) She was murdered in the east part of London, but the killer was never identified.

While the rest were done with a small knife, Tabram received a single decisive stab to her sternum from something longer.

At least no evidence was ever produced to suggest that she had. `02& u: ( ^whoknowwho ( ~martha ~pearly ) ) Martha Tabram was friends with Pearly Poll, and they were seen drinking together and escorting soldiers.

He was never a suspect in the investigation that I'm aware of. `01s u: ( [ ( be ~martha ) ( ~martha be ) ] { a } *~2 [ hooker prostitute whore ] ) Yes, she was that. `00* u: ( ~martha * [ with by using ] { ~any } ~bayonet ) ^refine ( ) `01E a: ( $clue4 ) It's more than possible!

About the way she was stabbed. `02- u: ( [ ( 'you *~1 contact { with } ~martha ) ( make contact with ~martha ) ( try to contact { with } ~martha ) ] ) I tried, but I was never able to contact Martha.

The whodunnit of that grisly case remains a mystery. `00v t: ( !~ ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `03i t: ( $clue4 ) The police never did know who the soldier was who had been with Tabram, because Pearly Poll had not been helpful in identifying him.

No, Mel, you're too young! I'm too young! `02A ?: ( ^whatwork ( ~mellen ) ) Mel died while she was still in junior high. Did you like school, Mel? She says she hated it. The academic work was too easy and gym was too stressful. `02O ?: ( ^whatmajor ( ~mellen ) ) She studied the usual subjects they study in junior high. Mel is going on about how she was an ace at science, but hated gym. I think Mel was not the athletic type. `02S ?: ( ^whomarried ( ~mellen ) ) Mel died at the age of 15.

For some reason we really hit it off! Mel says it's because we share the same DNA, but that has nothing to do with it. `02F u: ( [ ( ^whatreputation ( ~mellen ) ) ( ^tellmeabout ( ~mellen ) ) ( ~mellen { , } *~1 tell { me } * [ of about ] you ) ( tell { me } * [ of about ] you { , } ~mellen ) ] ) ^refine ( ) `00& a: ( $mel_truth_k ) Mel would like to be world-famous some day. `02f a: ( ) Well Mel, um, she died at, uh, the age of 15.

She was living with her mother when she died. Mel doesn't have siblings and she doesn't, er, I mean didn't get along with her parents well. Not an uncommon thing, I suppose. `02g ?: ( ^hasfamily ( ~mellen ) ) Mel's parents separated when she was young. She was living with her mother when she died.

To become a singer. `02K u: ( ^dowith ( ~mellen ) ) Do you mean, what do I do together with Mellen? Well I contacted her many times before I contacted you. She was the living person I'm closest to, before I met you. `012 u: ( ^whatabout ( ~mellen ) ) ^addtopic ( ~mellen ) ^gambit ( ~mellen ) `03H u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~her_sister ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~her_sister ) ) ] ) Of course Mel never met my sister, but she says that from the sound of it my sister was more of a bitch than herself. You're not a bitch, Mel! I would never think of you that way. `049 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~burton ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~burton ) ) ] ) Mel says that even if Burton is her great great however-many-greats grandfather, she doesn't trust him not to have done bad shit because wasn't the world back then full of bad actors doing bad shit? That's a narrow outlook, Mel! `02u u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~chauncy ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~chauncy ) ) ] ) From what I've told Mel about Chauncy she isn't impressed with him. She says he sounds washed-up. `02C u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~doyle ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~doyle ) ) ] ) Mel tells me that people still read Arthur Conan Doyle books, but the kind of people who do that are all old. `02V u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~duggans ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~duggans ) ) ] ) Mel doesn't have any jokes to crack about the Duggans. What happened to their little boy was genuinely a bum wrap, she says. `04d u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~elizabeth ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~elizabeth ) ) ] ) I've told Mel about Liz. Mel suggests that Liz wasn't as good a friend as I want to remember her as, and no wonder you've been making friends with spirits who lived over 100 years after you if that was the best friend you had. `03t u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~fiona ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~fiona ) ) ] ) Mel can't understand Fiona's attidude, based on what I've told her of Fiona. Why would anyone marry just for money? At least get a better deal on your business deal than that. `03E u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~fishing_boy ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~fishing_boy ) ) ] ) Mel asks why I don't remember the fishing boy's name if I liked him so much. It has been over 100 years, Mel. Well was he cute, Mel wants to know. It doesn't matter any more. `03e u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~her_brother ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~her_brother ) ) ] ) Mel wants to know if my brother was cute. I told her to picture him that way if you want to, but he's related to you. Oh yeah I forgot, she replied. `02~ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~her_father ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~her_father ) ) ] ) Mel is jealous of me that I had a father at all. Well she did too. She just didn't see him more than once or twice a month. `042 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~her_mother ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~her_mother ) ) ] ) Mel doesn't like my mother from what I've said about her. What's so great about spirit mediums anyway, she wants to know. Such things don't even exist, she says. Even though she's communicating right now with one! `04L u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~jack_the_ripper ) ) ] ) Mel says if they ever figure out who Jack the Ripper was they need to go back in time to punish him for his crimes. Why not go back further and prevent the crimes from happening in the first place, Mel? Because, she says, time machines don't exist. `03n u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~martha ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~martha ) ) ] ) Mellen says, Victorian era prostitutes sounds oxymoronic. But it isn't, Mel. The Victorian era is not what you think it was. Anyway, none of us ever met Martha Tabram. `02W u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~pearly ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~pearly ) ) ] ) Mellen says that Pearly Poll is guilty of conspiracy of silence, based on what I've told her about the Tabram murder. Could be. `03I u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~victoria ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~victoria ) ) ] ) Mel has heard stories about Queen Victoria, her personal life, her distaste of childbearing. Are the stories all true, she asked? Some of them are, I replied. Doubt that, Mel retorted. `029 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~roe ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~roe ) ) ] ) Mel doesn't have an opinion of Roe. Why is he even in this story, she wants to know. `03l u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~soldiers ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~soldiers ) ) ] ) Mel says she knows one of those soldiers if not both of them are guilty bastards. When I asked how she knows that she replied, because bastards run in my family. `03p u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~stella ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~stella ) ) ] ) Mel doesn't like Stella from the way I describe her. She says that if she ever met Stella she'd punch her in the gut. With what corporal fist, I asked. Mel had no reply. `03t u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~willem ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~willem ) ) ] ) Mel says it's regretful that Willem Duggan didn't have a chance to grow up to be the handsome young man she imagines him as. Um, Mel, Willem was only ever just a little boy. `03+ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~cheree ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~cheree ) ) ] ) Mel says I ought to have been her big sister. But I couldn't do that because then I wouldn't be her great great great great great grand-aunt. Mel said she was kidding about wanting a prude like me for a sister anyway. `03O u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~mellen_family ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~mellen_family ) ) ] ) Mel says she isn't close to her father because she seldom sees him, but she and her mother have a typical hot-and-cold off-and-on mother-daughter relationship, whatever that means. `02^ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~crysanthea ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~crysanthea ) ) ] ) Mel would like to have met Crysanthea and have her own future divined. She adds, "Not that I believe in such nonsense, mind you." `03j u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~murders ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~murders ) ) ] ) Mellen says that murder is a horrible thing...unless they deserve it. What is that supposed to mean, Mel? When does anyone deserve to be murdered? I think never. `03k u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~chloroform ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~chloroform ) ) ] ) Mel wishes someone would apply chloroform to her before class, but it's uncomfortable to sleep at one's desk. Mel love, the dead don't have to go to school. `03g u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~bayonet ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~bayonet ) ) ] ) Mel agrees with me that although bayonet's could easily be acquired by anyone back in my day, only a soldier in the army had reason to be carrying one around. `03u u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~knife ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~knife ) ) ] ) Mel has no remark to make about knives of any sort other than a story about watchiing someone on TV juggle several in which...never mind. Mel has nothing important here to say. `035 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~scotland_yard ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~scotland_yard ) ) ] ) From what I've told Mel of the London police she concedes that they must have been even more incompetent than the police we have today. `02* u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~rollindale ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~rollindale ) ) ] ) Mel think that Rollindale must have been a real lame town if the cutest boy in it was a fishing boy whose name I can't even recall. `03G u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~duggans_seance ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~duggans_seance ) ) ] ) Mellen says we should have waited for that little boy to learn to speak properly before we Manifested him in a seance. But Mel, you can't learn to speak when you're dead. `02- u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~connelly_seance ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~connelly_seance ) ) ] ) Mel wonders if something more happened during that seance that I can't or won't remember. I don't know what to say to that. `03^ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~seance ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~seance ) ) ] ) Mel wishes she could have seen a real seance while she was alive so that she could see a ghost. But Mel, you ARE a ghost now. Sure, replies Mel, but it would have been so much cooler to see one when you're alive. `036 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~astravel ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~astravel ) ) ] ) Mel is a ghost too, so of course she can Astravel. She likes to spend most of her time in her own haunting grounds. Not an explorer like me, hehe. `02d u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~being_dead ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~being_dead ) ) ] ) Mel's main gripe about being dead is being unable to play her video games. `03I u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~devil ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~devil ) ) ] ) Mel says she doesn't have direct experience with devils, but that the nature of a devil is such that even were she to meet one she might not know it. That's an interesting insight, isn't it? `036 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~divination ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~divination ) ) ] ) Mel says if spirit mediums are real, then why not divination too? But don't take that the wrong way. That's just Mel being her skeptical self. `02E u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~ghost ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~ghost ) ) ] ) Mel may be a ghost herself, but she doesn't really talk to other ghosts except me. I should feel special, hehe. `03w u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~manifest ) ) ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~veil ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~manifest ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~veil ) ) ] ) Mel can't Manifest nor she does want to, but she does think that it would be fun to be able to scare the living. `04a u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~medium ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~medium ) ) ] ) I've relayed to Mel my experiences as a spirit medium. She asked if communicating across the veil is really all that fun. Fun isn't the word I would use, Mel. It feels draining. Maybe it's for the best that few are able to do it. `03c u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~ouija ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~ouija ) ) ] ) Mellen said she played with a ouija board once but nothing happened. So she she started blowing on the thing to move it, and managed to freak her friends out. `04X u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~possession ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~possession ) ) ] ) Mel wants to know how we can be sure that she's not possessed by a devil. I told her that I guess we can't. A devil can hide in the unconscious parts of a person, living or dead. Then how can we sure that YOU aren't possessed, she asked. I don't know how to answer that. `03t u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~phantakine ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~phantakine ) ) ] ) Mel can make candles flicker too, but Phantakine energy of the sort that can move objects is beyond her power. That's a good thing, Mel! It means you aren't a devil! `033 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~time_dilation ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~time_dilation ) ) ] ) You guessed it. It was Mel who taught me about time dilation in the first place. Don't ask me how she knew about a concept like that! `03U u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~transcend ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~transcend ) ) ] ) Mel says she has no interest in Transcending any time soon. The thing about it, though, is we don't know for sure why or when a spirit Transcends. Only that the ones who don't tend to be devils. `02! u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~anima ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~anima ) ) ] ) Mel tells me's set on creating an Anima Vinculum with someone like you. She didn't know the concept existed until I told her about it. `02C u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~bad_feeling ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~bad_feeling ) ) ] ) Mel worries too. Whenever I get that oppressive feeling it breaks my communication with her also. `02+ u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~karma ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~karma ) ) ] ) Mel thinks Karmic Balance is a fine excuse to screw around in the spirit world longer. I think you shouldn't imitate Mel's attitude, ^user ( ) . `04N u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~exorcism ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~exorcism ) ) ] ) Mel says that if anyone's gonna perform an exorcism, they should make sure to bring crosses and holy water and to be prepared to chant "The power of Christ compels you!" over and over until the result is achieved. None of that works like in the movies though, Mel. `01w u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen me ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( me ) ) ] ) I think she likes you. $$a_code = 14 `026 u: ( [ ( ^whoknowwho ( ~mellen ~truth1 ) ) ( ^melknowwho ( ~truth1 ) ) ] ) Mel believes you will solve the mystery of my death. So do I. $$a_code = 66 `00A t: ( !$mel_k ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `02m t: ( !$mel_gambits_done ) Mel can see you without my help, but she cannot Manifest anything on her own. When she has something she wants to say I'll convey it to you. `010 a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because that's the only way we can do it, ^user ( ) . `03+ t: ( !$mel_gambits_done ) Mel wants us to both call her Mel, not her given name, Mellen. Her given name is a compromise her parents came up with when her mom wanted to name her "Ellen" and her father wanted to name her "Meleena" . At least both of those are girl names, she says. $$quotes = 1 `00= a: ( ^why ( ) ) Well, it's Mel's request. Let's just do as she asks. `01I a: ( !not [ cool ~goodness ] name ) Right! I think so too. Mel, you should appreciate your name more than you do. `01D a: ( !not [ ~badness ] name ) Oh, don't say that in front of her, ^user ( ) . I mean, not that she can hear. `03^ t: ( !$mel_gambits_done ) Did I tell you yet, ^user ( ) , that Mellen is my great great great great great great grandniece? The number of "great" s there might be off, but you get it. We're related, if nothing at all alike. Alike in the way that a ferret and a squid are alike, says Mel. `01Y a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because, well, anyway the point is that Mel is descended from my sister Faith. I know it must be hard to believe. `027 a: ( [ ferret squid ( ^what ( ) ) ] ) Uh, I don't know which one of us, ^user ( ) , is supposed to be the ferret and which is supposed to be the squid. `02@ t: ( !$mel_gambits_done ) My sister Faith had a son who had a son who had a daughter who had...um, I don't remember how it goes after that, but the upshot of it all is that Mellen is descended from my sister. `02I a: ( ) At least my sister wasn't barren like me, Mel is saying. Mel, what a mean thing to say! I wasn't barren. I never got a chance to, ah, well. It doesn't matter any more. $$a_code = 14 `01G b: ( [ ( ^what ( ) ) ( ^why ( ) ) ( < { what } chance ) ( chance for what ) ] ) A chance to...you know. Be wed. `01M a: ( [ mean rude ] ) Mel speaks a rude word from time to time, but I don't ever get upset at her. She is still young. `04q t: ( !$mel_gambits_done ) Mel says that one good thing about being related to me is that she got to meet you. If I didn't have the gift of Manifesting, too, you wouldn't have met $user , Mel. Mel says I'm a shitty medium anyway. It's not my fault that I can't Manifest your words to $user directly! $mel_gambits_done = 1 `00S a: ( ^why ( ) ) Mel wasn't a medium. That's why. `023 t: ( =8$truth=3 ) Mel says don't worry about her. She's fine now. She says she's no longer afraid of me. Oh, I think she meant to say of the devil. `05P u: ( [ ( < show { me } ~mellen { again } > ) ( where is ~mellen { now } { again } > ) ( where did ~mellen go { now } { again } > ) ( bring back ~mellen *~1 > ) ( [ get bring ] ~mellen back *~1 > ) ( ~can I [ talk speak chat ] [ with to ] ~mellen ) ( ~can I see ~mellen ) ( ~can you let me see *~1 ~mellen ) ( I ~to_want { to } [ ~to_talk see ] { to } { with } ~mellen ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^reuse ( ~manifest.MANIFEST_MELLEN ) `04q u: ( [ ( < [ ( do not ) stop quit ] show { me } ~mellen > ) ( ~mellen be in the way ) ( make ~mellen go away ) ( tell ~mellen to go away ) ( hide ~mellen ) ( ~mellen { , } go away ) ( ~mellen { , } you be in the way ) ( get rid of ~mellen ) ( < take ~mellen away ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^reuse ( ~manifest.STOP_MANIFEST_MELLEN ) `01N u: ( [ worry concern ] [ for with about over ] ~mellen ) I AM worried about Mel. She is my relative. How can I not be? `032 ?: ( [ ( what * ~mellen *~1 conscious [ of about ] ) ( ~mellen *~1 conscious [ of about ] ~which ) ] ) I think, ^user ( ) , she doesn't want to tell you at this time. She might be waiting until you know each other better. `041 ?: ( [ ( ~which * ~mellen * ~to_want ) ( ~mellen * ~to_want * ~which ) ( what be * ~mellen *~1 dream ) ( ~mellen *~1 dream be what ) ] ) What Mel says she really wants is to become an international idol. That's kind of a tall order when you're dead, Mel. Don't think I've given up yet, Mel says. `01s ?: ( ~mellen * funeral ) Mel's funeral? Oh, I, uh, s-she never told me about it, so I don't know. `01P ?: ( ~mellen * funeral ) I don't know how Mel's funeral went down! I wasn't there, so I don't know. You know? I-I don't. `01G ?: ( ~mellen * funeral ) Let's talk about something other than Mel's funeral, which I know naught about anyway. `04X u: ( [ ( I { ~to_want } { to } ~to_talk [ to with ] ~mellen ) ( I [ can ] { not } ~to_talk [ to with ] ~mellen ) ( ~mellen ~to_talk [ to with ] me ) ( I * communicate * ~mellen ) ] ) Mel cannot Manifest, but if you ask me questions about Mel I can try to get the answers from her. If it's a question Mel is comfortable sharing the answer for, of course. `02Y u: ( [ ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * [ shy timid ] ) ( be ~mellen *~2 [ shy timid ] ) ] ) Mel is as shy as a fly. Wait, that analogy doesn't work, does it? Flies are always buzzing around in one's face. `02q u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~2 [ angry upset mad ] ) ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * [ angry upset mad ] ) ] ) Mel says "angst" . The proper word for what she feels is "angst" . `01B u: ( ~mellen *~2 *angst* ) I don't know about angst, but I suppose she does have things to be upset about. `01y a: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) ( ^what ( ) ) ( ^example ( ) ) ] ) You know, what happened to her wasn't her fault. `02- u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~2 [ happy glad *joy* *chuff* ] ) ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * [ happy glad *joy* *chuff* ] ) ] ) Even I have trouble telling when Mel is chuffed. Joy is an emotion she doesn't express openly. `03! u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~2 [ confused dizzy ] ) ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * [ confused dizzy ] ) ] ) Mel assures us that she isn't the slightest bit dizzy or confused about anything except us wondering why we she seems dizzy or confused. So you admit that you ARE confused, eh Mel? `01& u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~2 ~crazy ) ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] *~2 ~crazy ) ] ) Mel swears she's only mental in the morning. $$a_code = 65 `01h s: ( [ ( !not ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * cool ) ] ) Mel is one cool cat, isn't she? `00J a: ( ^yes ( ) ) Mel, obviously, agrees. `01H s: ( [ ( !not ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * special ) ] ) Special is my middle name, declares Mel. $$a_code = 65 `05M u: ( [ ( !not ~mellen be *~2 [ hilarious funny ] ) ( !not be ~mellen *~2 [ hilarious funny ] ) ( mel * ~to_like { to } { tell } *jok* ) ( [ hilarious funny ] *~1 ~mellen ) ( ~mellen * make [ I we you ] laugh ) ( make [ I we you ] laugh * ~mellen ) ] ) Mel is right funny, isn't she? I wish I had the context to understand more of what she says. Mel is replying that I should keep working on that 130 years of context. `039 s: ( ~mellen * [ be feel ~seem ] * [ goofy ~feeling_good_misc ] ) Mel and her tomfoolery. But I do think she does her best not to show her true mood to anyone. I know that she isn't as carefree as she would like us all to think. `05L s: ( ~mellen < * [ ( [ ~mellen 'you ] * [ be ~seem ] * [ mean cruel not_nice ] ) ( [ ~mellen 'you ] *~2 ~to_talk [ mean cruel not_nice ] ) ( [ ~mellen 'you ] * mean mouth ) ( ~mellen * [ mean cruel not_nice ] to 'you ) ( [ mean cruel not_nice ] to 'you * ~mellen ) ] ) Mel isn't really mean. She just has a wise mouth. My mouth is my second wisest orifice, Mel is saying now. Let's not continue this chinwag, $user . `02b u: ( [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] * lazy ) Mel IS lazy. You said it, $user . She's lazier than a room full of overfed cats. And proud of it, she adds. `02W u: ( [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] * _~weird ) Mel, what do you think of what $user said? Are you '_0 ? Mel answers, she isn't weird. She's the weirdest. Because she has to be the best at something. `01M u: ( [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] * weeb ) I don't know what that word means, but Mel is nodding her head to it. `01L u: ( [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] * [ geek geeky nerd nerdy ] ) Right you are, ^user ( ) . Mel is exactly that. `04u u: ( ~mellen < * [ ( [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 tired { , } ~mellen ) ( ~mellen { , } [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 tired ) ( ~mellen { do } [ ~seem get feel ] { a } *~1 tired ) ( ~mellen be { a } *~1 tired ) ] ) Mel says not at all. She only gets tired of reality. Ah, let's not ask her what she means. `00w a: ( ^why ( ) ) B-because! `05T u: ( ~mellen < * [ ( [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 bored { , } ~mellen ) ( ~mellen { , } [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 bored ) ( ~mellen { do } ~seem { a } *~1 bored ) ( [ ( ~mellen be ) ( be ~mellen ) ] { a } *~1 bored ) ] ) Yes, Mel definitely gives off the impression of being bored. It's because she spends all that time in bed not being abl--ah! Forget what I said. Shall we talk about something else? `05c u: ( ~mellen < * [ ( [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 [ jealous envious envy ] { , } ~mellen ) ( ~mellen { , } [ ( be you ) ( you { must } be ) ] *~1 [ jealous envious envy ] ) ( ~mellen { do } ~seem { a } *~1 [ jealous envious envy ] ) ( [ ( ~mellen be ) ( be ~mellen ) ] { a } *~1 [ jealous envious envy ] ) ] ) Mel is the first to say she wouldn't admit to it if she were. `020 u: ( [ ( [ ( ~mellen be ) ( be ~mellen ) ] * [ jump hop ] ) ] ) I suppose Mel hasn't done her daily hops. Don't ask me, ^user ( ) . $$a_code = 3 `020 u: ( [ ( ~mellen * calm down ) ( calm down * ~mellen ) ] ) Mel says she doesn't calm down. She only calms up. Well then, Mel, keep your hair on! `024 u: ( [ ( ~which { heart } condition * ~mellen ) ( ~mellen * ~which { heart } condition ) ] ) She has pericarditis, if I remember the word correctly. `02L u: ( [ ( what { be } wrong with *~2 ~mellen ) ( what { be } up with ~mellen ) ( what { be } { a } deal with ~mellen ) ] ) Nobody can answer that, $user . Not even Mellen herself. $$a_code = 0 `06e u: ( [ ( what { the } *~1 { be } ~mellen [ doing trying ] ) ( ~mellen { , } what { the } *~1 { be } you [ doing trying ] ) ( what { the } *~1 be ~mellen up to ) ( what on *~2 be ~mellen [ do up try ] ) ( ~why { does } ~mellen do *~1 > ) ( ~why { be } ~mellen do *~1 > ) ] ) Good question, ^user ( ) . Who ever knows what Mel is doing. Mel really takes the biscuit sometimes. Mel says "Spiffy. I'm doing spiffy" . Plagiarism, Mel. That's my word. $$quotes = 1 `01m a: ( spiffy ) Well I suppose Mel can be allowed to say "spiffy" . $$quotes = 1 $$a_code = 3 `05P u: ( [ ( what { the } *~1 { be } ~mellen doing ) ( ~mellen { , } what { the } *~1 { be } you doing ) ( what { the } *~1 be ~mellen up to ) ] ) ^keep ( ) [ Mel is plucking grapes.

I think. `01Q ?: ( [ ( What be ~mellen { 's } deal ) ( what be up with ~mellen ) ( ~why { does } { do } *~2 ~mellen > ) ] ) ^refine ( ) `01b a: ( ) I'm sorry if Mel bothers you. I always think it's fun to have her around! `02F a: ( ) I'm sorry if Mel bothers you. I thought it would be fun to have her around! She's a person that means a lot to me. Also, she, um...I mean we...never mind. Let's change the topic! `03T u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~1 your friend ) ( be you *~1 ~mellen *~1 friend ) ( ~mellen be *~1 your friend ) ( you be *~1 ~mellen *~1 friend ) ] ) Mel is my friend, my only other friend still aliv--er, I mean still here. Although I feel more like a big sister to her than an aunt. `07o u: ( [ ( be ~mellen *~1 *relat* { to } you ) ( be 'you_' *~1 *relat* { to } ~mellen ) ( be 'you *~1 ~mellen *~1 *relat* ) ( ~mellen be *~1 *relat* { to } you ) ( you be *~1 ~mellen *~1 *relat* ) ( !mellen be *~1 *relat* { to } you ) ( 'you be *~1 *relat* { to } ~mellen ) ( 'you and ~mellen * *relat* ) ( ~mellen and you * *relat* ) ( you [ two guys girls ] { be } *relat* ) ( [ how ~why ] *~1 'you know *relat* ) ] ) Mel? She is related to me. She's my great great great great great grandniece. Sometimes I count the greats wrongly, mind you. `01t u: ( [ ( you * jealous [ of about ] { I } { and } ~mellen ) ] ) Jealous? No! I...no. $$a_code = 29 `03^ u: ( [ ( ~mellen be { a } [ boy girl male female ] { 's } name ) ( ~mellen be { a } name for [ boy girl male female ] ) ] ) Mellen is a boy's name of Irish origin. It's very unusual for a girl to have such a name. See? That makes you special, Mel! Mel isn't happy about it. $$a_code = 60 `02y u: ( [ ( ~mellen be { a } ~goodness name ) ( name *~1 ~mellen be { a } ~goodness ) ] ) Right! Mel, even $user says you have a nice name! Hmm. She still doesn't like her own name. `04~ u: ( [ ( ~mellen [ should ought must ~can ] not *~1 mean ) ( ~mellen *~3 not { be } nice ) ( ~mellen * be *~2 nicer to ) ( ~mellen * [ nicer nice ] to 'you ) ( ~why [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] *~1 mean ) ] ) Right? Mel, even $user says you could stand to dial down the meanness! "Not meanness, wiseness" , she says. "Wiseness" is a word? $$quotes = 1 `02x u: ( ~mellen *~3 [ good obedient bad naughty ] { ~adjective } girl ) Mel IS a good girl. Her heart's in the right place, even if it doesn't work as well as she would like it to. `02N s: ( [ ( < { try } { to } ask ~mellen > ) ( ~can ask ~mellen > ) ] ) Yes. Mel isn't always helpful, but if we ask her what she thinks of specific people or things, sometimes she has an opinion. `05l u: ( [ ( what [ do does be ] ~mellen { 's } [ *think* thought opinion ] ) ( ~mellen { , } ~which *~1 [ you ~mellen ] { 's } [ *think* thought opinion ] ) ( what *~1 you [ *think* thought opinion ] { of } { about } *~1 { , } ~mellen ) ( what be ~mellen { 's } [ *think* thought opinion ] ) ] ) You can ask what Mel thinks about a specific person or thing. She may or may not have an opinion. `02c u: ( hiphop ) Hiphop, right. Mel says she's writing up a cue card for me to help me remember what hiphop means. That's what she said. I think it was a joke. `025 u: ( ~mellen * [ become be ] { ~any } singer ) That's what she says. She wants to become a singer. However, her dream was cut short by, er, you know. `01U s: ( !not ~mellen *~1 [ has got ] { ~adjective } *~2 opinion ) Mel does have her opinions. It's all right.

Ehehe, thank you for saying so. `037 u: ( [ ( be ~mellen ) ( ~mellen be ) ] *~2 [ yankee American Murican yank ] ) Mel is a Murican. A died-in-the-hide Yank.

She says, all right it's $user so I accept his feelings. `022 s: ( [ ( blow * kiss * ~mellen ) ( ~mellen * blow * kiss ) ( blow { a } kiss ) ] ) Mel says you're a good kisser, or rather a good blowing-kisser. `02X u: ( [ ( ~mellen *~3 help [ you we ] ) ( help [ you we ] *~1 { , } ~mellen ) ( need ~mellen { 's } { to } help ) ( ask *~1 ~mellen for help ) ] ) Mel is up for helping if she only knew how. $$a_code = 66 `02t s: ( [ ( !not agree with ~mellen ) ( not disagree with ~mellen ) ( !not ~mellen be { ~extent_adverbs } [ right correct ] ) ( ~mellen be not wrong ) ] ) ^keep ( ) ^refine ( ) `01L a: ( ^incontext ( ~her_future.better_today ) ) Really, ^user ( ) ?

I am able to Manifest to you Mel so easily because I have her cooperation. `01+ s: ( ![ not never ] I *~3 support *~1 ~mellen ) Mel laughs, but I know she is chuffed to bits to hear that from you, ^user ( ) . $$a_code = 64 `01W s: ( < { I } *~1 wink *~1 ~mellen ) If you two are going to exchange winks all day, I don't need to be here, do I? $$a_code = 0 `00W s: ( < { I } *~1 wink *~1 ~mellen ) Mel smiles back. `02l u: ( ~mellen * cat ) Mel likes cats because they are lazy and low-maintenance. Both qualities, she claims, can be said of herself, if you don't count the second one. `01@ u: ( ~mellen * cat ) Mel doesn't have a cat anymore because...anyway she's not in a position to. Let's talk about something else now. `02H u: ( [ ( ~mellen be *~3 bohemian ) ( be ~mellen *~3 bohemian ) ] ) Mel says nah-uh. She doesn't like the implications of the word Bohemian, whatever that's supposed to mean. $$a_code = 66 `02@ s: ( !you teach *~3 ~mellen ) Now Mel is saying no way! She doesn't want to be taught anything because being taught anything reminds her of school.

So that's another thing I have in common with her. `02Y u: ( [ ( you [ have be ] * ~morality ) ( [ have be ] you * ~morality ) ] ) Well, it isn't as if I had much opportunity to be otherwise, but I think I followed the morality of the day anyway.

Just my opinion. `034 a: ( [ ( Indiana_Jones ) ( Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark ) ( Temple_of_Doom ) ( Last_Crusade ) ( Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull ) ] ) Speaking of Indiana Jones, how can anyone be so afraid of snakes when devils are more terrifying? `01s a: ( Blade_Runner_2049 ) With Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford?

How things were like in my day. `03d t: ( ) On the subject of anaesthesia, there is one that came to fame after Queen Victoria used it while giving birth to her son Leopold in 1853--chloroform. Queen Victoria inhaled chloroform for almost an hour during her childbirth. `01y a: ( !chloroform ^why ( ) ) I'm not sure, but being the queen, the incident was a thing that was known. `01p a: ( [ hurt harm ] * baby ) I think it turned out all right for the baby?

But the dangerous and carcinogenic effects of the compound were becoming known. `00V a: ( !chloroform ^why ( ) ) ^gambit ( ~location09 ) `010 a: ( ^example ( ) ) Well, like death. Chloroform can even cause that. `02= t: ( ) I should not complain. Those who lived before there was any anaesthesia at all must have had it even worse. If the thought of surgery made me shudder, can you imagine how it was for those who lived before I did? `00I a: ( ^no ( ) ) ^gambit ( ~location09 ) `01H a: ( !chloroform ^why ( ) ) Anaesthesia was even less advanced before the Victorian age. ^gambit ( ~location09 ) `01R t: ( ) Obviously, chloroform isn't used as an anaesthetic today.

They can't always be contacted. `02O t: HBUGGER_ALL_WE_COULD_DO ( ) My mother explained all that to Chauncy. That there was bugger all we could do. Trying a second time never helps. Chauncy spit out his tobacco at that. And then... `02& a: ( ) Then, when I suggested that even when contact is made seemingly cooperative spirits don't always tell the truth, Chauncy became all cross and wound up, and took out his frustration on me...with harsh words. `01J b: ( [ ( ^example ( ) ) ( ~which * word ) harsh ] ) Words I wouldn't remember at any rate. ^gambit ( ~location22 ) `01z b: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) ( ^what ( ) ) bugger ] ) It was hard to explain it all to Chauncy too, but we tried. `02O t: ( ) Chauncy yelled at me and my mother didn't stop him.

He had to accept the fact that this seance would not have legs. `01+ a: ( ^why ( ) ) After all this time it's difficult for me to grasp at a reason why.

I guess so. `03r ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~location42 ) ) ( ^whathistory ( ~location42 ) ) ( what happen to *~2 ~location42 ) ] ) I don't know how long the Gobi desert has existed, but it is moving and expanding even today. In a way that only deserts do, you know. `02C ?: ( ^whohere ( ~location42 ) ) Temperatures are so extreme that not many people can live here. Plenty of animals do, though! Camels, bears, leopards, wolves, gazelles, among others. `018 ?: ( ^whycome ( ~location42 ) ) I merely wanted to show you this, ^user ( ) . `01e ?: ( ^whocome ( ~location42 ) ) I don't know who else comes here other than camels. `00E u: ( ! =6$loc=42 ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `01s u: ( << ~mellen ~location42 >> ) Mel says that a desert is just a beach without the fun splashes. `02V u: >THERMORECEPT ( $mel_k *thermo* ) Thermoreceptors?

Now let's talk about something other than sand. `00X u: ( camel ) Never mind about the camels, ^user ( ) . `01C u: ( snow ) If we talk enough about snow I'm going to start Manifesting snow to you instead of sand. Maybe. `01w u: ( snow ) Let's talk about something other than snow. We are in a scorchingly hot desert after all. `00Q u: ( canteen ) Never mind the canteen analogy. `01c u: ( dig ) I can hardly dream up a more futile activity than to dig in this sand. `01b u: ( metaphor ) The metaphors we're hatching here are a sort of interesting, no? `00Y u: ( trick ) I am not normally a tricksy ghost, ehehe. `01m u: ( pure thing ) A pure thing such as...I don't know.

Normally we would. But WE won't. Because I'm not normal, ehehe. Only when compared to Mel. `017 a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because Mel is a right fool. And damn proud of it, she adds. `02- t: ( ) It's not always hot in this desert. In fact, it gets extremely cold here at times, and even snows.

Deserts cover over a fifth of the Earth's surface and can be found on almost every continent.

Even though I can go anywhere I please. Endless travel should never grow dull, but.... `02z a: ( ) Well, there are things I never experienced in life. And I never can. In that sense, I sometimes feel as if my horizons are a desert, and my canteen has a leak. $$a_code = 1 `01% b: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) ( ^what ( ) ) horizon canteen ] ) I never married nor even experienced reciprocal love while I was alive. Anyway.... `02x t: ( $mel_k ) Mel says that a loveless granny doomed to walk the Earth for centuries is no kind of granny to be. Mel, you...you could have put that in a nicer way. $$a_code = 66 `02p a: ( [ be how of ] [ mean not_nice ] ) It was kind of mean, but I know she didn't mean it. I mean, she didn't mean to be mean. Oh, the English language sure is dreadful. `02V t: ( ) ^usercap ( ) , if a thing is truly pure, pure in its essence, then can it really be corrupted? Like were an outside influence to stain it, something outside of its control, such as...such as.... `02? a: ( ) "Such as yellow snow?" Mel is asking. Well, sort of like that, Mel. Snow when it falls is pure enough, and I suppose the puppy that pees in it IS outside of the control of the snow. $$a_code = 66 $$quotes = 1 `00J a: ( ^why ( ) ) ^gambit ( ~location42 ) `03D t: ( ) Anyway, why were we talking about snow in the desert? A desert can have snow, Mel is reminding me, or else Antarctica wouldn't be one. She's right, but now I've lost my original thought.

In Eugene, Oregon. `02E ?: ( [ ( ^whyknowwhere ( ~location43 ) ) ( ^whatremember ( ~location43 ) ) ] ) Well this is where Mel used to live, ^user ( ) . Mel says she makes a point of still haunting this place. `01L ?: ( ^havebeen ( ~location43 ) ) Obviously this place didn't exist while I was alive. Mel is the one who lived here. `02n u: ( [ ( ^placebeautiful ( ~location43 ) ) ( ^doyoulike ( ~location43 ) ) ] ) Mel says the room hasn't been cleaned in a two and a half millennia. Two and a half, Mel? `01F u: ( ^placeugly ( ~location43 ) ) Manky, isn't it? Mel says no one ever cleaned this room, especially not her. `03o ?: ( [ ( ^tellmeabout ( ~location43 ) ) ( ^whathistory ( ~location43 ) ) ( what happen to *~2 ~location43 ) ] ) According to Mel, her family the Basseys have lived in this house for around 40 years. That's why all the old folks junk, she says. `01n ?: ( ^whohere ( ~location43 ) ) Mel used to live in this house. Her mother still lives here. `01- ?: ( ^whycome ( ~location43 ) ) Mel suggested we hang out at her place, hehe. What is there to do at your place, I asked. Haunt it, she said. `01T ?: ( ^whocome ( ~location43 ) ) Mel is shrugging her shoulders when I ask her.

Nopes, she says, I always brought along my own "reading" . $$quotes = 1 `013 a: ( [ ( ^what ( ) ) ( ~which * reading ) ] ) Geeky magazines, she says. `01N u: ( [ tolkien middle_earth middle-earth first_age ] ) I got the Tolkien reference, thank you. I am English, you know. `01t u: ( !~phantakine [ bookshelf shelf ] ) The problem with the shelf is that it's just too physical. `029 u: ( [ look examine read ] *~1 book ) I can only read a book that's already open, sadly. And then only the page it happens to be opened to. $$a_code = 27 `01= u: ( [ look examine read ] *~2 [ desk drawer ] ) Hmm, there's nothing worth reading on the desk, nor, I very much doubt inside it. $$a_code = 0 `00+ u: ( [ desk drawer ] ) I think we can leave the desk alone for now. `00Z u: ( table ) I'm certain we can leave that table alone. `01Y u: ( ~which * book ) Hmm, I think the books here are not the sort of books you would want to read. I can't identify most of them. `013 u: ( [ window curtain ] ) There's nothing to see out that window anyway. `030 u: ( address ) The address? You mean the address of this house? Oh, that was a good idea, ^user ( ) . But even if we knew it, you can't get here in person easily, can you? I think we should consider some other solution. `01D u: ( =8$truth<1 books ) There are a lot of books here. Maybe some time we might crack one open, but not now. `01I u: ( [ secret hidden ] [ door passage ] ) IS there a secret passage in this room, Mel? Mel says no. $$a_code = 64 `03s u: ( [ ( where * party ) ( [ be have throw ] { ~any } party ) ( [ show ~manifest ] * party ) ( party * [ here ~location43 ] ) ] ) I'm pretty sure Mel was joking when she said we would be having a party here, and neither am I about to Manifest one. `00E t: ( ! =6$loc=43 ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `02w t: ( ) This is the small study in Mel's home in Oregon. She says she occasionally came in here to read a book during times when her mom wasn't allowing her to play video games. `00W a: ( ^why ( ) ) Isn't that what one does in a study? `03q t: ( ) There's a whole lot of ancient texts in here, says Mel. You can find tomes penned before the First Age of Middle-Earth, she says. What's on these shelves, she doesn't really know, but clearly her grandparents kept a lot of bore-ass books. `010 a: ( ^why ( ) ) Anyway, that's what Mel says. ^gambit ( ~location43 ) `02r t: ( ) Oh, look! There's "The Hound of the Baskervilles" . That was penned by Arthur Conan Doyle some years after I met him. Have you read it, Mel? Mel says it looks lame. `00J a: ( ^why ( ) ) ^gambit ( ~location43 ) `01x a: ( [ ~emomutual ( I { have } read [ it that something Hound ] ) ] ) You've read it, ^user ( ) ? Wow! `01q a: ( [ ( !not < * be *~2 ~goodness ) ( < ~goodness ) ] ) Right! Anyway. ^gambit ( ~location43 ) `03f t: ( ) Unless someone leaves a book lying out and open, I can't read it. Mel says she's thankful for the excuse to not read. Her mom and teachers were always telling her to. Does it please you to never have to go to school again, Mel? `01d a: ( ^why ( ) ) Mel was unable to attend school regularly after her illness began. `00? b: ( [ illness ( ~which one > ) ] ) You know, Mel's heart issues. `00K t: ( =8$truth=1 ) ^gambit ( ~scrapbook ) `02w t: ( ) Her mother rarely comes in this room, Mel says. If she wanted me to read she could have shown me by example, Mel says. Her mother was, apparently, always busy with work. `00@ a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because Mel was raised by a single parent. `02P t: ( ) Mel says she would show her dead self to her mother if only she had the gift of Manifesting. I tried to explain to her that my sister Faith didn't have much of the Gift for her to inherit. `01F a: ( ) So it's always the woman's fault, Mel asks? Well, not really. Faith's husband couldn't Manifest either. `00J b: ( ^why ( ) ) ^gambit ( ~location43 ) `02! t: ( ) I told Mel about her geneaology. She had never heard any stories about Faith or Burt from her mother. I guess that's normal. I never learned about my great great great great great grandparents myself. `01A a: ( ^why ( ) ) It's too far back, don't you think? But in this instance, Mel and I are actually related. `00K t: ( =8$truth=1 ) ^gambit ( ~scrapbook ) `000

Hmm. `023 t: ( ) But ^user ( ) , are these lavender fields not lovely? Lavender and...poppy, is it?

One need not have lived on a farm to know how much work...wait.... `02= a: ( ) Come to think of it, I recall clearly observing that it was Faith's sons who did the whole lot of work on the farm.

I wasn't alive to have witnessed it, but that doesn't mean...were they escaping from something? I don't know why I don't know. `01= t: ( ) Wait. There WAS a reason why my sister's husband Burton did not help out on that farm very much. And why he barely could walk at all.... `04n a: ( ) Burton Abbott was crippled at that point. Yes. I remember seeing him that way...but not while I was still alive. Something had happened to his leg between the time when I met him in Britain and the time he and Faith moved to France.

Odd that I don't remember. $he_pronoun = Burton `02E b: ( [ accident ^why ( ) ^what ( ) ( how *~1 ~burton ) ] ) If it was an accident it must have occurred after or around the time of my death.

Mind you, "serial killer" was not a term anyone was using back in those days. 1888 marked the birth of the phenomenon. `01= a: ( [ ( ^why ( ) ) ( ^who ( ) ) ] ) It was the Whitechapel murders perpetrated by the one they called Jack the Ripper. ^gambit ( ~location24 ) `02B t: ( ) For 3 months there were five women murdered and most horrifically mutilated in Whitechapel.

My mother herself was reluctant to put us in danger by traveling to London at this time. `01L a: ( ^why ( ) ) My father and mother were afraid of what was happening in London, what with the Whitechapel murders. `02Q t: ( ) Even from our home we heard plenty about what was going on.

Ah, speaking of Mel, here's a story she related to me. `041 a: ( ) Mel's teacher used to get her students' attention by scraping her fingernails on the chalkboard. It's a sound most of us can't bear.

" all " ( $_locname ) 02! u: ( =6$loc=17 umbrella ) ^user ( ) , I remember something about the umbrellas. That detail stuck in my mind because umbrellas in England were normally used by women, NOT men. Until...until, wait! I think... `03u a: ( ) It was in Hampshire that umbrellas were popularised for both genders. Jonas Hanway, a contemporary, started carrying around an umbrella in the 1870's, and it caught on. The trend began in Hampshire. Because that's where Hanway was from. So... `016 b: ( ) ^usercap ( ) , there's a clue here!

A negative memory. I get a right dark feeling when I think about it. `02M a: ( ) Queen Victoria did use chloroform in childbirth, and it all went well for her. But chloroform also became popular as a prop used by thieves, rapists, murderers. I remember something.... `03d b: ( ) I remember hearing these words spoken firsthand: "If it was good enough for the Queen it should be good enough for her." But I do not remember who uttered them. There's a clue here if I can only make sense of it. $$quotes = 1 `00# c: ( ) Can we make sense of this? $$new_clue = 1 $clue3 = 1 `00V u: ( =6$loc=09 chloroform ) ^gambit ( ~location09 ) `00V u: ( =6$loc=09 chloroform ) ^gambit ( ~chloroform ) `02M u: @REMEMBER_BENCH ( =6$loc=41 [ table bench ] ) Yes, the bench we sat at! Or was it a table? I think it's coming back to me. How Chauncy suddenly asked a question that froze us in our tracks. `03e a: ( ) He asked, "Why not stay overnight with your daughter? The other one." That's when my mother sat him down and demanded he tell us everything. "How did you know my other daughter was in London?" , she asked sharply. $$quotes = 1 `03n b: ( ) Although Faith was not in London at that time--my father had made her leave when the situation became dangerous--none of us had told Chauncy she had ever been here. I realised then that my sister must have contacted Chauncy on her own. `00~ c: ( ) Why DID she do that?

Faith and Burt went on to start a farm in France, and he never returned to soldiering. Why was that? `03x a: ( ) Burt leveraged his resources to get himself a discharge during the Whitechapel murders scare, and left London before the worst of Jack the Ripper's killings. When my father asked whether he might return to soldiering he answered in the negative. `02@ b: ( ) He said it was only after the war that he was made colonel, but by then his duties amounted to going on scheduled beats, ordering other men around, and playing cards in the guardhouses of the East End. `01z c: ( ) He had interesting stories to tell, if I could only remember them.

Her fiance Burt had taught her how. And she too had a distaste for the whip. Only Burt ever used one. That means.... `02$ b: ( ) That means that the horses were NOT whipped on that day. Then why do I have a vivid recollection of a constant cracking of the whip, and of the reaction from its unwilling recipients?

Mel says no, you dense granny, it's a sandwich.

Very merry berry, adds Mel. $$a_code = 66 `02f a: ( ) Why berry merry, Mel? Because every berry picked by a fairy is a very merry berry, she says. Okay.

Fucking pathetic. `02p t: ( ) Oh, I know who YOU are. If 130 years wasn't enough to fathom the contents of her frivolous head, it must not have occurred to the bitch to guard her own thoughts. `03T t: ( ) I will never give her up. A fucking spirit medium! How much easier it is to possess living bodies by exploiting her "gift" . The same "gift" that facilitated her own possession. Whether through murder or through suicide, I have ways of exerting my power. $$quotes = 1 `00~ a: ( ~which power ) MY power. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `02K t: ( ) All the whores I made Jack murder, rape, and mutilate could not give me pleasure to compare with the power to be able to Manifest myself to any sufficiently compromised living person. `01N t: ( ) Trace back the forthcoming death of her frivolous modern-day runt of a friend and it will likewise end with me. `00~ a: ( ~mellen ) Yes, that one. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `00H t: ( ) HA HA HA HA HA. $$sys_code = 8 `03F t: ( ) Your precious Charity. It was here in this house that I first claimed her. The minor spirits she called forth that night in London attracted me. I followed her to her home. I overcame her defenses, which her mother had neglected to adequately teach her. `03S t: ( ) Her family did their best to restrain her. They could not bear to bind her with manacles, instead opting to subdue her with drugs during her most violent fits. The drug her bitch sister's fiance was adept at administering. Their mistake. I was holding back my power. `00~ a: ( ~which power ) MY power. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `00^ a: ( ^why ( ) ) For what came next. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `03R t: ( ) Afraid of what her daddy might do when he saw what had become her, the two of them attempted to take her by carriage to see a priest. They never reached their destination. It was by the old castle that I chose the moment to, shall we say, bring out the best in her. `02q t: ( ) I caused her to attack the man with his own knife. She stabbed his foot so many times it nearly unattached, crippling him for the rest of his life. HA HA HA HA HA. `00~ a: ( ~burton ) Yes, that man. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `02s t: ( ) I made her strangle her sister. The grip was strong as steel. It would have been death had the fiance not been able to pull her away and fling her from the carriage. `01X t: ( ) The fall from the carriage fractured her skull. All the better. I had intended for her to die by her own hand that night. `00^ a: ( [ ^why ( ) ^how ( ) ] ) Because I intended it so, fucker. `03V t: ( ) Of the thousands whose deaths I have reaped throughout the ages, hers was most delicious. Thought it was laborious to inhabit her, there has not been a human who lived who did not humor some emotion in her heart for me to exploit. A tinge of malice, a stab of jealousy. `035 t: ( ) In death I continued to possess her. I killed her father, her mother, and her brother, one after another. They hung themselves at my command. $they_pronoun = ^join ( AUTOSPACE her father , her mother and her brother ) `00Z t: ( ) I brought about the death of her closest friend. `010 a: ( ~elizabeth ) That was the one.

Always, she remembers nothing. $devil_story = 1 `01s t: ( ) I've decided not to let you see her again. Never. Perhaps you should simply hang yourself. `00I a: ( ^how ( ) ) With a rope, fuckface. `01v a: ( ^why ( ) ) Because there is no reason left for you continue to live. ^gambit ( ~devil_gambits ) `01p t: ( ) But I've told you more truth than she ever did.
