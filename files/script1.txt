Hmmm. ] [ Many things that don't make sense turn out to be true. ] `01F ?: ( do you not agree ) [ Of course I agree. ] [ The logic is irrefutable. ] [ Why does my agreement matter? ] `01C s: ( I do not plan ) [ Plans aren't everything, right? ] [ I think many things happen that are unplanned. ] `02K u: 9CANTYOU ( I < * can * not < !~qwords ) [ You can't? ] [ b: Is it that you can't or that you won't? ] [ Why not? ] [ Maybe you will learn how someday. ] [ I think someone somewhere can. ] `00N b: ( can * not ) Are you handicapped?
